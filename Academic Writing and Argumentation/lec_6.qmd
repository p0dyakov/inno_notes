#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Introduction to Descriptive Paragraphs**
A **descriptive paragraph** is a focused piece of writing that aims to create a clear and vivid picture of a subject in the reader's mind. Its primary goal is to describe the main features of a person, object, place, or concept using clear, specific details. Rather than telling the reader something, it shows them by appealing to their senses and intellect, allowing them to form their own mental image of the topic.

##### **1.2 Common Applications**
Descriptive paragraphs are a fundamental tool in technical and academic writing. They are typically used in the following scenarios:
*   **Describing an object:** Explaining the physical or logical components of a piece of hardware, a tool, or any other tangible item.
*   **Describing a process:** Outlining the steps or stages of a procedure, workflow, or event in a logical sequence.
*   **Providing a classification or typology:** Grouping items into categories based on shared characteristics and describing the features of each category, as seen in the malware example.

##### **1.3 The Structure of a Descriptive Paragraph**
A well-formed descriptive paragraph follows a clear and logical structure, ensuring the reader can easily understand the information presented.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
*   **Paragraph Head (Topic Sentence):** This is the opening sentence that introduces the main subject of the paragraph. It should be direct and engaging, clearly stating what will be described without using announcing phrases like "This paragraph will describe..." or "I am going to tell you about...".
*   **Body (Features and Details):** The body of the paragraph is built around the main *features* or characteristics of the subject. Each feature is introduced and then supported by several **details**. These details must consist of *relevant information*â€”facts, explanations, or examples that are essential for the reader to understand the description. For instance, when describing a computer virus, a key feature is how it spreads, and a relevant detail would be its attachment to a file that executes when opened.
*   **Concluding Sentence:** This is the final sentence of the paragraph. It provides closure by either summarizing the main features discussed or rephrasing the paragraph head in a new way, reinforcing the paragraph's main idea.

##### **1.4 Key Writing Tips**
To write an effective descriptive paragraph, especially in a technical or academic context, adhere to the following guidelines:
*   **Use Neutral Language:** Rely on objective, neutral words that describe the subject accurately without arousing strong emotions. The goal is to inform, not to persuade.
*   **Strive for Clarity:** Make your description as clear and unambiguous as possible. Avoid jargon where possible, and explain it if it's necessary.
*   **Add a Title:** A concise title helps frame the topic for the reader.
*   **Ensure Grammatical Correctness:** Check that all sentences are complete, containing both a subject and a verb.
*   **Maintain an Effective Academic Style:** Your writing should be formal, concise, and logically structured.
*   **Proofread Diligently:** Ask a peer to proofread your first draft to catch errors you might have missed.
*   **Learn from Mistakes:** Take note of frequent errors in your writing and make a conscious effort to avoid them in the future.

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Descriptive Paragraph**: A paragraph focused on creating a clear, detailed picture of a person, place, object, or concept in the reader's mind.
*   **Paragraph Head**: The topic sentence that introduces the subject of the paragraph.
*   **Feature**: A main characteristic or distinct aspect of the subject being described.
*   **Detail**: A specific piece of relevant information, such as a fact or an explanation, that elaborates on a feature.
*   **Concluding Sentence**: The final sentence that summarizes the main points or restates the paragraph head to provide closure.

#### **3. Mistakes**

*   **Announcing your topic directly:** Using phrases like "I will now describe the CPU." **Why it's wrong:** This is considered poor style in academic writing. The paragraph head should introduce the topic naturally without explicitly stating the author's intent.
*   **Using vague or general language:** Describing something as "good" or "interesting" without providing specific details. **Why it's wrong:** Descriptive writing relies on precision. The reader cannot form a clear picture from terms that are subjective and lack concrete information.
*   **Disorganized information:** Presenting features and details in a random, illogical order. **Why it's wrong:** A lack of structure confuses the reader. Information should be organized logically (e.g., from general to specific, top to bottom, or by category) to be easily understood.
*   **Omitting a concluding sentence:** Ending the paragraph abruptly after the last detail. **Why it's wrong:** The concluding sentence is crucial for signaling that the description is complete and for reinforcing the main point, leaving the reader with a sense of closure.
*   **Including irrelevant information:** Adding details that do not directly support the feature being described. **Why it's wrong:** Extraneous information distracts the reader and weakens the paragraph's focus and clarity.
*   **Relying on emotionally charged words:** Using biased or subjective language instead of neutral, objective terms. **Why it's wrong:** In technical and academic writing, the goal is objective clarity, not emotional persuasion. Emotional words can undermine the credibility of the description.

**Malware Types**

Malware is intrusive software that is designed to damage and destroy computer systems. Such software can be commonly classified into viruses, worms, and Trojans. The first malware type is viruses. A virus is attached to a file that supports macros to execute its code and spread from host to host. Once downloaded, a virus will lay dormant until the file is opened and used. The second malware type is worms. Worms need no host programs to exponentially replicate and spread to any device within the network. The last malware type is trojans. Trojans are disguised as helpful software. Once downloaded, a trojan can access sensitive data and then modify, block, or delete them. However, trojans are not designed to self-replicate. To conclude, the most well-known malware types are viruses, worms, and trojans.

---
***Analysis:***
*   **Paragraph Head:** The first two sentences introduce the topic (malware) and the classification (viruses, worms, and Trojans).
*   **Features & Details:** The paragraph discusses three features: viruses, worms, and Trojans. Each feature is supported by details explaining its function and behavior.
*   **Concluding Sentence:** The final sentence summarizes the three types discussed, providing closure.

**Components of a CPU**

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that executes instructions, and it is fundamentally composed of two core operational parts: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and the Control Unit (CU). The first major component is the ALU. This unit is responsible for performing all mathematical calculations, such as addition and subtraction, and logical operations, such as AND, OR, and NOT. The second core component is the Control Unit. The CU acts as the manager of the CPU by directing and coordinating most of the computer's operations. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and then directs the ALU and other components to execute them in the correct sequence. In essence, the ALU performs the calculations while the CU manages the workflow.

---
***Analysis:***
*   **Paragraph Head:** The first sentence defines the CPU and introduces its two main components.
*   **Features & Details:** The paragraph describes two features: the ALU and the CU. Each feature is followed by details explaining its specific functions and responsibilities within the CPU.
*   **Concluding Sentence:** The final sentence summarizes the distinct roles of the ALU and CU, reinforcing the paragraph's main idea.
