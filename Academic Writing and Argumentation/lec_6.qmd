#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Introduction to Descriptive Paragraphs**
A **descriptive paragraph** is a focused piece of writing that aims to create a clear and vivid picture of a subject in the reader's mind. Its primary goal is to describe the main features of a person, object, place, or concept using clear, specific details. Rather than telling the reader something, it shows them by appealing to their senses and intellect, allowing them to form their own mental image of the topic.

##### **1.2 Common Applications**
Descriptive paragraphs are a fundamental tool in technical and academic writing. They are typically used in the following scenarios:

*   **Describing an object:** Explaining the physical or logical components of a piece of hardware, a tool, or any other tangible item.
*   **Describing a process:** Outlining the steps or stages of a procedure, workflow, or event in a logical sequence.
*   **Providing a classification or typology:** Grouping items into categories based on shared characteristics and describing the features of each category, as seen in the malware example.

##### **1.3 The Structure of a Descriptive Paragraph**
A well-formed descriptive paragraph follows a clear and logical structure, ensuring the reader can easily understand the information presented.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

*   **Paragraph Head (Topic Sentence):** This is the opening sentence that introduces the main subject of the paragraph. It should be direct and engaging, clearly stating what will be described without using announcing phrases like "This paragraph will describe..." or "I am going to tell you about...".
*   **Body (Features and Details):** The body of the paragraph is built around the main *features* or characteristics of the subject. Each feature is introduced and then supported by several **details**. These details must consist of *relevant information*—facts, explanations, or examples that are essential for the reader to understand the description. For instance, when describing a computer virus, a key feature is how it spreads, and a relevant detail would be its attachment to a file that executes when opened.
*   **Concluding Sentence:** This is the final sentence of the paragraph. It provides closure by either summarizing the main features discussed or rephrasing the paragraph head in a new way, reinforcing the paragraph's main idea.

##### **1.4 Key Writing Tips**
To write an effective descriptive paragraph, especially in a technical or academic context, adhere to the following guidelines:

*   **Use Neutral Language:** Rely on objective, neutral words that describe the subject accurately without arousing strong emotions. The goal is to inform, not to persuade.
*   **Strive for Clarity:** Make your description as clear and unambiguous as possible. Avoid jargon where possible, and explain it if it's necessary.
*   **Add a Title:** A concise title helps frame the topic for the reader.
*   **Ensure Grammatical Correctness:** Check that all sentences are complete, containing both a subject and a verb.
*   **Maintain an Effective Academic Style:** Your writing should be formal, concise, and logically structured.
*   **Proofread Diligently:** Ask a peer to proofread your first draft to catch errors you might have missed.
*   **Learn from Mistakes:** Take note of frequent errors in your writing and make a conscious effort to avoid them in the future.

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Descriptive Paragraph**: A paragraph focused on creating a clear, detailed picture of a person, place, object, or concept in the reader's mind.
*   **Paragraph Head**: The topic sentence that introduces the subject of the paragraph.
*   **Feature**: A main characteristic or distinct aspect of the subject being described.
*   **Detail**: A specific piece of relevant information, such as a fact or an explanation, that elaborates on a feature.
*   **Concluding Sentence**: The final sentence that summarizes the main points or restates the paragraph head to provide closure.

#### **3. Mistakes**

*   **Announcing your topic directly:** Using phrases like "I will now describe the CPU." **Why it's wrong:** This is considered poor style in academic writing. The paragraph head should introduce the topic naturally without explicitly stating the author's intent.
*   **Using vague or general language:** Describing something as "good" or "interesting" without providing specific details. **Why it's wrong:** Descriptive writing relies on precision. The reader cannot form a clear picture from terms that are subjective and lack concrete information.
*   **Disorganized information:** Presenting features and details in a random, illogical order. **Why it's wrong:** A lack of structure confuses the reader. Information should be organized logically (e.g., from general to specific, top to bottom, or by category) to be easily understood.
*   **Omitting a concluding sentence:** Ending the paragraph abruptly after the last detail. **Why it's wrong:** The concluding sentence is crucial for signaling that the description is complete and for reinforcing the main point, leaving the reader with a sense of closure.
*   **Including irrelevant information:** Adding details that do not directly support the feature being described. **Why it's wrong:** Extraneous information distracts the reader and weakens the paragraph's focus and clarity.
*   **Relying on emotionally charged words:** Using biased or subjective language instead of neutral, objective terms. **Why it's wrong:** In technical and academic writing, the goal is objective clarity, not emotional persuasion. Emotional words can undermine the credibility of the description.

Evaluate the following single-paragraph assignment for strict compliance and quality. Be blunt,
direct, and unsparing. Do not praise. Identify every flaw. Then provide concrete, minimal edits
and a corrected model paragraph.

Student’s paragraph:
[PASTE THE STUDENT’S SINGLE PARAGRAPH HERE. ONE PARAGRAPH ONLY.]

Evaluation constraints and scoring:
1) Task match and scope
- Must be exactly one descriptive paragraph about one of: a real-world object, a process, or a
classification/typology. If not, say “Fail: wrong task.”
- No tables, bullet points, or headings inside the paragraph body. If present, say “Fail: format
violation.”

2) Paragraph head (topic + controlling idea)
- First 1–2 sentences must state the topic and a clear controlling idea without announcing (“This
paragraph will…”). If missing/weak, rewrite one strong head sentence.
- The head must preview the features (object: key attributes; process: major steps; classification:
the categories). If not, state exactly what is missing.

3) Supporting sentences: explanation + details
- At least 3 supporting sentences that explain the controlling idea and add relevant, concrete
details: facts, examples, brief reasons, expert view, or simple statistics—kept concise and
verifiable in tone. If details are vague or irrelevant, label them and replace with precise
alternatives.
- For processes: steps must be clear and sequential; for classifications: categories must be
distinct and exemplified; for objects: salient features must be described with measurable or
observable properties. If not, supply corrected content.

4) Concluding sentence
- Final sentence must restate the controlling idea or summarize the features; no new information.
If it adds new info or is missing, rewrite it correctly.

5) Coherence and transitions
- Enforce known–new contract: sentence openings should anchor known info; sentence endings
should introduce new info. Identify every violation and show one-line fixes.
- Require explicit transitions every 2–3 sentences (e.g., First, Second, Finally; However;
Consequently). Insert minimal, precise transitions where absent.

6) Style, tone, and concision
- Academic, neutral diction; no emotional language; no rhetorical questions. Flag and replace
any inflated or vague phrasing.
- Be concise and precise: remove redundancy, nominalizations that obscure meaning, and filler
qualifiers. Show a tightened version with tracked minimal edits.
- Grammar: every sentence must have a clear subject and finite verb; fix fragments, run-ons,
and comma splices.

7) Hard checks for the three descriptive options
- If Object is described: identify three distinct, observable features with concrete detail. If fewer
than three or not concrete, fix.
- If Process is described: identify and order three core steps with crisp, actionable phrasing. If out
of order or blended, fix.
- If Classification is described: present a clear set of categories; define each briefly; ensure
mutual clarity. If overlapping or undefined, fix.

Deliverables:
A) Compliance verdicts: Pass/Fail for each criterion (1–7) with one-line justification.
B) Line-by-line edits: show the student’s paragraph with minimal, necessary edits in brackets,
replacing weak words, tightening syntax, and inserting transitions; no rewrites beyond necessity.
C) Rewritten model paragraph: produce a fully compliant, high-quality paragraph for the same
chosen type and topic, using neutral academic style, strong head, three solid supports, correct
transitions, and a proper concluding sentence. Keep it under 150 words.
D) Micro-lessons (max 3 bullets): one sentence each on the exact errors the student tends to
make and how to avoid them next time. Be specific and operational.
