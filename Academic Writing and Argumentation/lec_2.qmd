#### 1. Summary

##### 1.1 Be Formal
A formal tone establishes objectivity and professionalism. It is a cornerstone of academic discourse, distinguishing it from casual communication.

*   **Avoid Contracted Forms:** Always write out the full forms of words.
    *   *Instead of:* "isn't," "wasn't," "mustn't"
    *   *Use:* "is not," "was not," "must not"
*   **Avoid Spoken Language:** Replace informal, conversational words with more formal and precise alternatives.
    *   *Instead of:* "The results have been *pretty good*."
    *   *Use:* "The results have been *encouraging*."
    *   *Instead of:* "...a *huge number* of unneeded connections..."
    *   *Use:* "...*numerous* unneeded connections..."
*   **Avoid Punctuation Showing Attitude:** Use words to convey emphasis, not punctuation like exclamation marks.
    *   *Instead of:* "Turnout in the election was less than 20 percent!"
    *   *Use:* "*Surprisingly*, turnout in the election was less than 20 percent."
    *   _Note: The source material contained a typo, "lection," which has been corrected to "election."_

##### 1.2 Be Concise
Conciseness means using the fewest words necessary to convey an idea clearly. Wordiness can obscure your argument and frustrate the reader.

*   **Avoid Phrasal Verbs:** Opt for single-word verbs.
    *   *Instead of:* "The committee *brought up* this issue..."
    *   *Use:* "The committee *raised* this issue..."
*   **Avoid Negatives:** Use affirmative words where possible.
    *   *Instead of:* "not many," "did not accept," "did not stay"
    *   *Use:* "few," "rejected," "left"
*   **Avoid Redundant Pairs and Modifiers:** These are words that repeat the same meaning.
    *   *Examples:* "any and all" (use "any"), "first and foremost" (use "first"), "completely finish" (use "finish"), "basic fundamentals" (use "fundamentals").
*   **Avoid Metaconcepts:** These are "concepts about concepts" that add unnecessary words.
    *   *Instead of:* "The *re-factoring strategy* seemed to be ineffective."
    *   *Use:* "*Re-factoring* seemed to be ineffective."

##### 1.3 Be Precise
Precision in language strengthens your arguments and prevents misinterpretation.

*   **Avoid Vague Words:** Replace subjective or non-specific words with precise terminology.
    *   *Instead of:* "The device performance is *bad*." or "This design is *good*."
    *   *Use:* "The device performance is *substandard*." or "This design is *effective*."
*   **Use Complete Lists:** Avoid using "etc." in formal lists. Specify all elements.
    *   *Instead of:* "...divides elements into metals, non-metals, etc."
    *   *Use:* "...divides elements into metals, non-metals, and semi-metals or metalloids."

##### 1.4 Be Cautious
Academic claims must be supported by evidence and presented with appropriate nuance.

*   **Avoid Generalizations:** Broad, sweeping statements are rarely accurate.
    *   *Instead of:* "*Everyone* has access to the Internet nowadays."
    *   *Use:* "Internet access is *widespread* nowadays."
*   **Avoid Emotions:** Maintain an objective tone.
    *   *Instead of:* "It is *stupid* to think that..."
    *   *Use:* "It is *debatable* to think that..."
*   **Use Hedging:** Use cautious language (hedging) to qualify claims and reflect the nuances of research.
    *   *Instead of:* "The virus *is* widespread in central Asia."
    *   *Use:* "The virus *appears to be* widespread in central Asia."

##### 1.5 Be Clear
Clarity ensures your reader can follow your line of reasoning without difficulty. This is achieved through direct sentence structures.

*   **Avoid Nominalization:** Use verbs instead of nouns derived from verbs, especially as the sentence's subject.
    *   **Nominalizations** are nouns created from verbs or adjectives (e.g., "optimization" from "optimize," "development" from "develop").
    *   *Instead of:* "*Optimization* of our work force is a key goal..."
    *   *Use:* "Our company primarily aims at *optimizing* the work force."
*   **Avoid Passive Voice (Generally):** The **active voice** is usually more direct and vigorous. In active voice, the subject performs the action.
    *   *Passive:* "The papers *were graded* by the teacher."
    *   *Active:* "The teacher *graded* the papers."
    *   *When to Use Passive Voice:* It is appropriate when the actor is unknown or unimportant, or to emphasize the object of the action. It is often used in the "Methods" section of scientific papers (e.g., "Samples were collected...").
*   **Use Action Verbs:** Replace weak "be" verbs (is, are, was, were) with dynamic, active verbs.
*   **Use Concrete Subjects:** Avoid starting sentences with expletives like "There is/are" and "It is."
    *   *Instead of:* "*There are* three ways to solve this problem."
    *   *Use:* "*This problem* has three solutions."
*   **Keep Subjects and Verbs Close:** Place the main subject and verb near the beginning of the sentence to improve readability.

##### 1.6 Be Careful with Pronouns (I, We, You)
The use of personal pronouns depends on the context and discipline.

*   **How to use "I":** Use "I" to describe research steps ("*I* collected the data") or to state your intention in a section ("In this chapter, *I* will..."). Do not use "I" to state personal opinions ("*I think* it is likely...").
*   **How to use "WE":** Use "we" to refer to a group of co-authors. Do not use "we" to group yourself with the reader ("*We* can stop obesity...").
*   **How to use "YOU":** Avoid using "you." Replace it with a concrete noun.
    *   *Instead of:* "*You* can see the results in Table 3."
    *   *Use:* "*Table 3* shows the results."

#### 2. Mistakes

*   **Using Informal Language:** This includes contractions ("don't"), slang ("a lot of stuff"), and emotional punctuation ("!"). **Why it's wrong:** Academic writing demands a formal and objective tone to maintain credibility. Informality makes the work seem unprofessional.
*   **Overusing the Passive Voice:** While sometimes necessary, overuse of the passive voice makes writing wordy, indirect, and can hide who is performing an action. **Why it's wrong:** The active voice is generally clearer, more concise, and more direct.
*   **Being Vague or Imprecise:** Using words like "good," "bad," or "things" weakens your argument. **Why it's wrong:** Academic discourse requires precision. Claims must be specific and quantifiable whenever possible to be convincing.
*   **Wordiness and Redundancy:** This involves using redundant pairs ("each and every"), unnecessary modifiers ("completely finish"), or overly complex sentences. **Why it's wrong:** Conciseness is a key principle of academic writing. Unnecessary words obscure your main points and make the text difficult to follow.
*   **Making Broad Generalizations:** Statements like "Everyone knows..." are usually inaccurate and unsupported. **Why it's wrong:** Academic claims must be cautious and supported by evidence. Generalizations undermine the credibility of the argument.
*   **Incorrect Use of Personal Pronouns:** Using "I" to state an opinion, "we" to include the reader, or "you" directly is often inappropriate. **Why it's wrong:** These practices can violate the objective, impersonal tone required in many academic disciplines.
