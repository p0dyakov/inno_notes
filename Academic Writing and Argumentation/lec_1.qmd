#### 1. Summary

##### 1.1 The Building Blocks: Sentences and Clauses

A **sentence** is the fundamental unit of written communication. To be complete, it must satisfy four conditions:

1.  It expresses a **complete thought**.
2.  It follows a specific grammatical **structure**.
3.  It begins with a **capital letter**.
4.  It ends with **punctuation** (a period, question mark, or exclamation point).

The core of every sentence is a **clause**. A clause is a group of words that contains two essential components:

*   A **subject**: The person, place, or thing performing the action.
*   A **verb**: The action or state of being.

The basic formula for a clause is: **Subject + Verb**.

If a group of words is missing a subject, a verb, or fails to express a complete thought, it is called a **fragment**. Fragments are incomplete and grammatically incorrect when used as standalone sentences.

*   *Example Fragment (missing subject and verb):* "At the restaurant."
*   *Example Fragment (missing subject):* "Have learned a lot today."
*   *Example Fragment (missing verb):* "Food at the restaurant."

##### 1.2 Clause Types: Independent vs. Dependent

Clauses can be categorized into two types, which function like components in a program.

*   **Independent Clause (or Main Clause):** This clause expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence. It's like a "main function" that can execute on its own.

    *   *Example:* "I like pizza."
    *   *Example:* "He has read a lot of books."

*   **Dependent Clause (or Subordinate Clause):** This clause does *not* express a complete thought and cannot stand alone. It must be attached to an independent clause to make sense. It functions like a "subroutine" or helper function that provides additional information. Dependent clauses often begin with a **subordinating conjunction** (e.g., *because, although, if, when, while*).

    *   *Example:* "Although I like pizza..."
    *   *Example:* "...because he has read a lot of books."

##### 1.3 Basic and Extended Sentence Structure

The most common sentence structure in English is **SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)**.

*   **Subject:** The doer of the action.
*   **Verb:** The action.
*   **Object:** The receiver of the action.

*   *Example (SVO):* **Nkuma (S)** **eats (V)** **apples (O)**.

*Correction Note:* *Some sentences do not have an object and follow a simpler **SV (Subject-Verb)** structure. For instance, in "Karim sleeps," **Karim** is the subject and **sleeps** is the verb. There is no object receiving an action.*

This basic structure can be extended with more details, such as **place** and **time**.

*   *Example (Extended):* **Karim (S)** **sleeps (V)** **at home (Place)** **on Mondays (Time)**.

##### 1.4 The Four Sentence Types

By combining independent and dependent clauses in different ways, we can create four types of sentences.

**1. Simple Sentence**
A simple sentence consists of exactly **one independent clause**.

*   *Structure:* `Independent Clause.`
*   *Example:* "A woman went to the gym."

**2. Compound Sentence**
A compound sentence consists of **two or more independent clauses** joined together. These clauses are typically linked by a comma and a **coordinating conjunction**.

*   *Structure:* `Independent Clause, [Coordinating Conjunction] Independent Clause.`
*   The coordinating conjunctions can be remembered with the acronym **FANBOYS**: **F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et, **S**o.
*   *Example:* "Dogs have masters, but cats have servants."

**3. Complex Sentence**
A complex sentence contains **one independent clause** and **at least one dependent clause**. The clauses are joined by a **subordinating conjunction** (like *because, since, whenever, although*). The punctuation depends on the order of the clauses.

*   *Structure 1 (No Comma):* `Independent Clause [Subordinating Conjunction] Dependent Clause.`
    *   *Example:* "A cannibal does not eat clowns because they taste funny."
*   *Structure 2 (Comma Required):* `[Subordinating Conjunction] Dependent Clause, Independent Clause.`
    *   *Example:* "Since clowns taste funny, a cannibal does not eat them."

**4. Compound-Complex Sentence**
This is a combination of the two previous types. It contains **at least two independent clauses** and **at least one dependent clause**.

*   *Structure Example:* `Dependent Clause, Independent Clause, [Coordinating Conjunction] Independent Clause.`
*   *Example:* "Although he organized his sources by theme, Mongo decided to arrange them chronologically, and he carefully followed the MEAL plan for organization."
*   **Warning:** Use these sentences carefully. While grammatically correct, they can become long and difficult to read, potentially making your writing less clear.

#### 2. Mistakes
*   **Using Sentence Fragments:** This common mistake involves writing a dependent clause or a phrase as if it were a complete sentence. This is incorrect because a dependent clause provides information but does not state a complete thought; it requires an independent clause to be grammatically correct.
*   **Creating a Comma Splice (Run-On Sentence):** This error occurs when two independent clauses are joined together with only a comma. Since both clauses represent complete thoughts, they must be separated by a period, a semicolon, or a comma followed by a coordinating conjunction.
*   **Forgetting the Comma in Complex Sentences:** When a complex sentence begins with a dependent clause, a comma must be placed after it. The comma acts as a logical separator, indicating to the reader that the introductory clause has ended and the main point is about to begin.
*   **Overusing Compound-Complex Sentences:** While these sentences can be powerful, they can also easily become convoluted and confusing. The primary goal of writing is clarity, and overly long sentences can force the reader to hold too many ideas in their head at once, which reduces readability. It is often more effective to break a complex idea into several shorter sentences.
