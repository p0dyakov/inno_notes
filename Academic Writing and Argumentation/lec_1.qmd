#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 What is a Sentence?**
A **sentence** is a fundamental unit of language that expresses a complete thought. To be considered a sentence, a group of words must satisfy four basic grammatical rules:

1.  It must contain a complete idea.
2.  It must have a specific grammatical structure, centered around a subject and a verb.
3.  It must begin with a capital letter.
4.  It must end with a punctuation mark (such as a period, question mark, or exclamation point).

##### **1.2 The Clause**
The core of every sentence is a **clause**. A clause is a group of words that contains both a **subject** (who or what performs the action) and a **verb** (the action or state of being). The simple formula is:

`Subject + Verb = Clause`

If a group of words lacks a subject, a verb, or both, it is not a clause. It is called a **sentence fragment**. A fragment cannot stand on its own because it does not express a complete thought.

*   *Example of a fragment:* "In the building at night." (This has no subject or verb).
*   *Example of a fragment:* "Have learned a lot today." (This has a verb phrase but is missing a subject).

##### **1.3 Clause Types**
Clauses are divided into two main categories: independent and dependent. The combination of these clause types determines the structure of a sentence.

###### **1.3.1 Independent Clause**
An **independent clause** (or **main clause**) contains a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought. It is grammatically complete and can stand alone as its own sentence.

*   *Example:* "I like pizza."
*   *Example:* "He has read a lot of books."

###### **1.3.2 Dependent Clause**
A **dependent clause** (or **subordinate clause**) also contains a subject and a verb, but it *does not* express a complete thought. It cannot stand alone as a sentence. It begins with a **subordinating conjunction** (e.g., `because`, `although`, `when`, `if`) which makes the clause reliant on an independent clause to complete its meaning.

*   *Example:* "Although I like pizza..." (The thought is incomplete).
*   *Example:* "...because he has read a lot of books." (This explains a reason but doesn't state the main idea).

##### **1.4 Sentence Types**
There are four main types of sentences in English, categorized by the number and type of clauses they contain.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.4.1 Simple Sentence**
A **simple sentence** consists of exactly *one independent clause*. It has a single subject and verb combination and expresses a single complete thought.

*   *Example:* "A woman went to the gym."
*   *Example:* "The black rabbit died yesterday."

###### **1.4.2 Compound Sentence**
A **compound sentence** consists of *two or more independent clauses* joined together. These clauses are typically linked by a **coordinating conjunction**. The most common coordinating conjunctions can be remembered with the acronym **FANBOYS**:

*   **F**or
*   **A**nd
*   **N**or
*   **B**ut
*   **O**r
*   **Y**et
*   **S**o

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

*Punctuation Rule:* When joining two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction, a **comma** must be placed *before* the conjunction.

`Independent Clause 1` + `,` + `Coordinating Conjunction` + `Independent Clause 2`

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

*   *Example:* "A woman went to the gym, and everybody liked her immediately."
*   *Example:* "The black rabbit died yesterday, so we have bought a white elephant today."

###### **1.4.3 Complex Sentence**
A **complex sentence** contains *one independent clause* and *at least one dependent clause*. The dependent clause is linked to the independent clause by a **subordinating conjunction** (e.g., `because`, `since`, `although`, `while`, `when`).

*Punctuation Rules:* The punctuation of a complex sentence depends on the order of the clauses.

1.  **No Comma:** If the independent clause comes first, followed by the dependent clause, no comma is needed.
    `Independent Clause` + `Subordinating Conjunction` + `Dependent Clause`
    <!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
    *   *Example:* "The woman went to the gym because she wanted to get fit."

2.  **Use a Comma:** If the dependent clause comes first, it must be followed by a comma before the independent clause.
    `Subordinating Conjunction` + `Dependent Clause` + `,` + `Independent Clause`
    <!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
    *   *Example:* "Because she wanted to get fit, the woman went to the gym."

###### **1.4.4 Compound-Complex Sentence**
A **compound-complex sentence** is the most intricate structure. It combines elements of both compound and complex sentences. It must contain *at least two independent clauses* and *at least one dependent clause*.

*   *Example:* "Although he organized his sources by theme, Mongo decided to arrange them chronologically, and he carefully followed the MEAL plan for organization."
    *   *Dependent Clause:* "Although he organized his sources by theme"
    *   *Independent Clause 1:* "Mongo decided to arrange them chronologically"
    *   *Independent Clause 2:* "he carefully followed the MEAL plan for organization"

*Warning:* Use compound-complex sentences carefully. While powerful, they can make your writing less readable if overused or constructed poorly.

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Sentence**: A grammatically complete unit of expression, containing a subject and verb, and conveying a complete thought.
*   **Clause**: A group of words containing a subject and a verb, forming the basic building block of a sentence.
*   **Independent Clause**: A clause that expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence.
*   **Dependent Clause**: A clause that contains a subject and verb but does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone. It begins with a subordinating conjunction.
*   **Sentence Fragment**: An incomplete sentence that is missing a subject, a verb, or both, and therefore does not express a complete thought.
*   **Simple Sentence**: A sentence consisting of only one independent clause.
*   **Compound Sentence**: A sentence consisting of two or more independent clauses, joined by a coordinating conjunction (like `and`, `but`, `or`).
*   **Complex Sentence**: A sentence consisting of one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.
*   **Compound-Complex Sentence**: A sentence consisting of two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.
*   **Coordinating Conjunction**: A word that connects two independent clauses (e.g., For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So - FANBOYS).
*   **Subordinating Conjunction**: A word that introduces a dependent clause and connects it to an independent clause (e.g., `because`, `if`, `although`, `when`).

#### **3. Mistakes**

*   **Writing sentence fragments:** Treating a dependent clause or a phrase as a complete sentence. **Why it's wrong:** A sentence must express a complete thought and have both a subject and a main verb to be grammatically correct. Fragments leave the reader waiting for more information.
*   **Creating a comma splice:** Joining two independent clauses with only a comma, without a coordinating conjunction. **Why it's wrong:** A comma alone is not strong enough to connect two complete thoughts. This error creates a run-on sentence. Use a comma and a conjunction (e.g., `, but`), a semicolon (`;`), or separate them into two sentences.
*   **Forgetting the comma after an introductory dependent clause:** Failing to place a comma after a dependent clause that starts a sentence. **Why it's wrong:** The comma signals the end of the introductory element and the beginning of the main part of the sentence, which prevents confusion for the reader.
*   **Using a comma in a complex sentence when the independent clause comes first:** Placing a comma before a subordinating conjunction like `because` or `while` when it appears in the middle of a sentence. **Why it's wrong:** No separation is needed when the main clause is presented first; the subordinating conjunction smoothly integrates the dependent clause.
*   **Overusing compound-complex sentences:** Constructing long, convoluted sentences that are difficult to follow. **Why it's wrong:** While grammatically correct, these sentences can obscure the main point and make the text less readable and engaging. Clarity should always be the priority.
