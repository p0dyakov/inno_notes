#### 1. Summary

##### 1.1 Common Sentence Problems

A well-formed sentence requires a clear subject and verb and must express a complete thought. The following are common errors that disrupt this structure.

*   **Sentence Fragments**: A **sentence fragment** is an *incomplete sentence* that is punctuated as if it were complete. It often lacks a subject, a verb, or both, or it may be a dependent clause that isn't connected to a main clause.
    *   *Fragment*: Because I could not find my shoes.
    *   *Correction*: I felt sad **because I could not find my shoes.** (The fragment is now joined to a complete sentence).

*   **Choppy Sentences**: These are short, simplistic sentences that follow one another. While grammatically correct, they make the text sound abrupt and fail to show the logical connections between ideas.
    *   *Choppy*: Our results were inconsistent. The program has an error. We need to talk to Paul Davis.
    *   *Correction*: We will ask Paul Davis to review the program for errors **because it produced inconsistent results.** (The sentences are combined to show cause and effect).

*   **Run-on Sentences**: A **run-on sentence** occurs when two or more *independent clauses* (complete sentences) are joined without proper punctuation or conjunctions.
    *   **Fused Sentence**: No punctuation is used between the clauses.
        *   *Fused*: The experiment failed it had been left unobserved too long.
    *   **Comma Splice**: Only a comma is used to join the clauses. A comma alone is not strong enough.
        *   *Comma Splice*: The experiment failed, it had been left unobserved too long.
    *   *Correction*: The experiment had been left unobserved for too long, **so** it failed. (A comma and a coordinating conjunction are added).

*   **Loose Sentences**: These sentences are overly long and convoluted, often placing the main idea at the very beginning and then adding a series of modifying phrases and clauses. This can make the core message difficult to follow.
    *   *Loose*: We got the contract, according to which we must be ready by June 1 with the necessary personnel and equipment to get the job done, so a staff meeting is scheduled for February 12.
    *   *Correction*: We must close the contract by June 1, **so a mandatory staff meeting is scheduled for February 12.** (The sentence is made more direct and concise).

*   **Coordination and Subordination Issues**:
    *   **Excessive Coordination**: This involves linking too many clauses with coordinating conjunctions like `and`. It creates rambling sentences where all ideas seem equally important.
    *   **Excessive Subordination**: This involves creating a complex sentence with too many dependent clauses, making it hard to understand the main point.
    *   *Correction*: Break the complex sentence into several simpler, clearer sentences that logically connect.

*   **Non-Parallel Structures**: In a list or series, all items must have the same grammatical form. This is called **parallelism**. When they don't, the structure is non-parallel.
    *   *Non-Parallel*: I like to swim, to sail, and rowing. (Two infinitives, one gerund).
    *   *Correction (Infinitives)*: I like **to swim, to sail, and to row.**
    *   *Correction (Gerunds)*: I like **swimming, sailing, and rowing.**

*   **That vs. Which**: These words introduce clauses, but are not interchangeable.
    *   Use **that** for a **restrictive clause**—information that is *essential* to the meaning of the sentence. Do not use a comma before `that`. If you remove the `that` clause, the meaning of the sentence changes fundamentally.
        *   *Example*: The thieves stole the pink elephant **that I love**. (This specifies *which* pink elephant was stolen).
    *   Use **which** for a **non-restrictive clause**—information that is *non-essential* or extra. Always use a comma before `which`. If you remove the `which` clause, the core meaning of the sentence remains intact.
        *   *Example*: The thieves stole the pink elephant, **which I love**. (This states the elephant was stolen and, as an aside, mentions that I love it).

##### 1.2 Using Commas Correctly

Commas signal a brief pause, separate items, and clarify sentence structure. While over-punctuating is generally better than under-punctuating, *never use a single comma to separate a subject from its verb*.

*   **Joining Independent Clauses**: Use a comma before a **coordinating conjunction** (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So—often remembered by the acronym **FANBOYS**) when it connects two independent clauses.
    *   *Example*: The program is finished, **but** it still has several bugs.

*   **Dependent Clauses**:
    *   When a *dependent clause* comes **before** the main clause, separate it with a comma.
        *   *Example*: **Since clowns taste funny,** a cannibal does not eat them.
    *   When a *dependent clause* comes **after** the main clause, do not use a comma.
        *   *Example*: A cannibal does not eat clowns **because they taste funny.**

*   **Separating Elements**:
    *   **Transitions**: Use a comma after a transitional word or phrase.
        *   *Example*: Clowns taste funny. **Therefore,** a cannibal does not eat them.
    *   **Lists**: Use commas to separate three or more items in a series.
        *   *Example*: My bath toys were a hairdryer, a toaster, **and** a radio.
    *   **Parenthetical Expressions & Appositives**: Use commas to set off extra information that could be removed without changing the sentence's basic meaning. An **appositive** is a specific type of parenthetical that renames a noun.
        *   *Parenthetical*: Clowns, **as most researchers know,** taste funny.
        *   *Appositive*: My dog, **Rex,** doesn't like cats.
        *   *Note*: While grammatically correct, inserting these expressions between a subject and verb can reduce readability. It is often more effective to place the expression at the beginning of the sentence or to restructure it.
    *   **Contrast**: Use a comma to separate contrasting phrases.
        *   *Example*: Cats have servants, **not masters.**

*   **Quotations**:
    *   *Reporting clause first*: He said, **"Polish the dull side."**
    *   *Quotation first*: "If you can't see the bright side of life," **he said.**
    *   *Interrupted quotation*: "If you can't see the bright side," **he said,** "polish the dull side."

##### 1.3 Formatting Lists

The punctuation for bulleted or numbered lists depends on whether the list items are complete sentences.

*   **Incomplete Sentence Items**: Use this format when the introductory stem and the list items form a complete sentence together.
    *   Introduce the list with a colon.
    *   Begin each item with a lowercase letter.
    *   End each item except the last with a semicolon.
    *   End the final item with a period.
    *   *Example*: My parents gave me the following toys:
        *   a hairdryer;
        *   a toaster;
        *   a radio.

*   **Complete Sentence Items**: Use this format when each list item is a standalone sentence.
    *   Introduce the list with a colon.
    *   Begin each item with a capital letter.
    *   End each item with a period.
    *   *Example*: Cannibals avoid clowns for the following reasons:
        *   Clowns run fast.
        *   Clowns taste funny.
        *   Clowns are scary.

#### 2. Mistakes

*   **Comma Splice**: Joining two complete sentences (independent clauses) with only a comma. **Why it's wrong**: A comma indicates a pause, but it is not strong enough to connect two separate, complete thoughts. You must use a period, a semicolon, or a comma followed by a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS).
*   **Punctuating a Sentence Fragment**: Placing a period after an incomplete thought. **Why it's wrong**: A sentence must have a subject and a verb to express a complete idea. A fragment leaves the reader waiting for the rest of the thought and should be integrated into an adjacent sentence.
*   **Separating a Subject from its Verb**: Placing a single comma between the subject of a clause and its main verb. **Why it's wrong**: The `Subject-Verb` pair is the core of a sentence. A single comma creates an unnatural and confusing separation. While a pair of commas can set off non-essential information, a single comma here is always an error.
*   **Using `that` and `which` incorrectly**: Confusing essential (restrictive) and non-essential (non-restrictive) clauses. **Why it's wrong**: This error misleads the reader. Using `which` for essential information (or `that` for non-essential information) changes the fundamental meaning of the sentence by signaling the wrong level of importance for the clause.
*   **Lack of Parallelism in Lists**: Writing items in a series with inconsistent grammatical structures. **Why it's wrong**: The brain processes patterns efficiently. When a pattern is broken, it creates a jarring effect that disrupts the flow of reading and makes the sentence harder to understand.
*   **Missing Comma Before FANBOYS in a Compound Sentence**: Forgetting the comma when joining two independent clauses with a conjunction like `and`, `but`, or `so`. **Why it's wrong**: Without the comma, the reader may not immediately see that a new, complete thought is beginning. The comma acts as a clear signal to pause and process the first clause before moving to the second.
