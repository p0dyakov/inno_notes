#### 1. Summary

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of academic integrity, focusing on how to properly use and credit sources to avoid plagiarism. We will cover the definition of plagiarism, the mechanics of referencing in IEEE style, and the essential techniques of summarizing and paraphrasing.

##### 1.1 What is Plagiarism?

**Plagiarism** is the act of presenting someone else's work, ideas, or words as your own without giving proper credit to the original source. It is a serious academic offense with severe consequences, which can include failing an assignment, being reported to the department, or even expulsion from the university.

A common guideline you might hear is to avoid using *"more than 3 words verbatim (word-for-word) in a row"* without referencing.

*A correction is warranted here: While this "three-word rule" is a helpful starting point, it is an oversimplification. True plagiarism is about the theft of **ideas** and **structure**, not just strings of words. Changing a few words in a sentence, a practice known as "patchwriting," is still considered plagiarism if the original sentence structure and idea are kept without proper attribution.*

##### 1.2 Plagiarism vs. Similarity

It's crucial to understand the difference between **plagiarism** and **similarity**.

*   **Plagiarism** is the *act of academic misconduct*. It is an ethical violation.
*   **Similarity** is a *metric* used by software (like Turnitin) to measure the percentage of text in your document that matches text in its database.

A high similarity score does not automatically mean you have plagiarized. Similarity tools can flag many things that are perfectly acceptable, including:

*   Properly cited **direct quotations**.
*   Names, titles, and established **terminology**.
*   Numerical data.
*   Commonly used phrases or nouns that are difficult to reword.
*   Your list of references.

The key is whether the matched text is properly attributed. If it is, it's not plagiarism.

##### 1.3 How to Avoid Plagiarism: Citing Sources

The primary way to avoid plagiarism is to cite your sources. A citation is a formal reference to the source of information. This is done through two connected components: **in-text citations** and a **reference list**.

This guide focuses on the **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) style**.

**In-Text Citations (IEEE Style)**

An **in-text citation** is a marker in your text that points the reader to the full source details in the reference list.

*   **Format:** Citations are numbers enclosed in square brackets, e.g., `[1]`.
*   **Numbering:** Citations are numbered sequentially, starting with `[1]`, in the order they appear in your writing.
*   **Placement:** The citation number should appear on the text line, have a space before it, and come *inside* the sentence's punctuation.
    *   **Example:** Researchers have confirmed that this method is effective [1].
*   **Multiple Authors:** For a source with three or more authors, use the first author's last name followed by *et al.* (Latin for "and others," always italicized).
    *   **Example:** Wood *et al.* [7] claim that...
*   **Multiple Sources:** You can reference multiple sources for a single point by listing each citation number.
    *   **Example:** Several recent studies [3], [4], [15] have suggested that...

**The Reference List**

The **reference list** appears at the end of your paper and provides the full publication details for every source cited in your text. Each numbered entry in the list corresponds to the in-text citation number.

##### 1.4 How to Avoid Plagiarism: Using Source Material

Beyond simply adding a citation, you must handle the source material correctly. There are three main ways to incorporate information from a source: quoting, summarizing, and paraphrasing.

###### **1.4.1 Direct Quotations**

A **direct quotation** is an exact, word-for-word copy of text from a source.

*   **When to use:** Use quotations when the author's original wording is precise, powerful, or essential to your point, or when you are providing a specific definition.
*   **Format:** Enclose the copied text in **quotation marks (" ")** and include an **in-text citation** with the page number if available.
    *   **Example:** Baez *et al.* have noted that "full 3D stacking can potentially offer additional advantages" [7, p. 14].
*   **Ellipsis:** If you need to omit unnecessary words from the middle of a quote, use an **ellipsis** (a set of three dots: `...`). Be careful not to change the original meaning of the sentence.
    *   **Example:** As seen in [5, p. 14], "the proposed circuit has improved signal attenuation ... and has been experiencing less performance degradation".

###### **1.4.2 Summarizing**

**Summarizing** involves restating the main ideas or arguments of a source in your own words, but in a condensed form. You give the main points but leave out the details.

*   **When to use:** Use a summary when the specific details of a source are irrelevant to your argument, but the main point is important.

###### **1.4.3 Paraphrasing**

**Paraphrasing** is rewriting a passage from a source in your own words and sentence structure while preserving the original meaning. A paraphrase is typically about the same length as the original passage.

*   **When to use:** Use paraphrasing to integrate an author's specific idea smoothly into your text, demonstrating that you fully understand it.
*   **Shared Language:** When paraphrasing, there are some words and phrases you cannot or should not change. This is called **shared language** and includes:
    *   Titles, proper nouns (names), and established terminology.
    *   Numerical data (dates, figures).
    *   Common nouns that are difficult to reword without sounding unnatural.

##### 1.5 How to Paraphrase in 6 Steps

Follow this process to create an effective and legitimate paraphrase.

Let's use this original text as an example: *"Only 9% of the students who work part-time earn sufficient income to support themselves."*

1.  **Read the original several times** until you are confident you understand its meaning.
2.  **Note key concepts and shared language.**
    *   Key concepts: small portion of working students are self-sufficient.
    *   Shared language: *9%*, *students*, *part-time*, *income*.
3.  **Write your version without looking at the original.** This forces you to use your own sentence structure.
    *   *First draft:* Of all the students who work part-time jobs, 9% make enough money to earn a living.
4.  **Compare your version with the original.** Check for phrases that are still too similar in structure or wording.
    *   *Comparison:* The phrase "the students who work part-time" is very close.
5.  **Change phrases that are still too similar.**
    *   *Second draft:* Of all the students with part-time jobs, just 9% make enough money to earn a living.
6.  **Cite your source as per IEEE.**
    *   *Final paraphrase:* According to [1], of all the students with part-time jobs, just 9% make enough money to earn a living.

##### 1.6 Reporting Verbs

When you introduce a quote or a paraphrase, use **reporting verbs** instead of always defaulting to "says" or "states". Stronger reporting verbs can accurately express the author's position or your evaluation of it.

*   **Neutral Verbs (use sparingly):** describes, explains, notes, writes.
*   **Stronger Verbs (to show the author's stance):** argues, claims, asserts, contends, suggests, insists.
*   **Stronger Verbs (to show your evaluation):** criticizes, dismisses, praises, evaluates.

*   **Example with a neutral verb:** The Asian Police Alliance [34] *says* the rise in drug trafficking is because of Western pop culture.
*   **Example with a stronger verb:** The Asian Police Alliance [34] *blames* the rise in drug trafficking on Western pop culture.

#### 2. Mistakes

*   **Incorrectly Formatting Citations.** A common error is to write sentences like "In reference [1], Jones discusses..." or "In Jones [2], a new approach is proposed." **Why it's wrong:** This phrasing is clunky and grammatically awkward. In IEEE style, the citation should be treated like a footnote number that points to the source, not as the subject of the sentence. The best practice is to name the author and place the citation immediately after, as in "Jones [1] discusses..."
*   **Believing the "Three-Word Rule" is Absolute.** Some students think that as long as they don't copy more than three consecutive words, they are safe from plagiarism. **Why it's wrong:** Plagiarism is about the uncredited use of *ideas and structure*, not just words. Changing a few words in a sentence ("patchwriting") while keeping the author's sentence structure and flow is still plagiarism. A proper paraphrase requires you to digest the idea and restate it using your own sentence structure and vocabulary.
*   **Forgetting to Cite a Paraphrase or Summary.** Students sometimes believe that if they put an idea into their own words, they don't need to cite it. **Why it's wrong:** Even when you use your own words, *the idea still belongs to the original author*. Failing to provide a citation for a paraphrased or summarized idea is a serious form of plagiarism.
*   **Using an Ellipsis to Misrepresent a Source.** An ellipsis (`...`) can be used to remove irrelevant words from a quotation, but it should never be used to alter the original meaning. **Why it's wrong:** Intentionally changing the author's argument by selectively omitting words is a form of academic dishonesty and misleads your reader.
*   **Mismatching In-Text Citations and the Reference List.** This occurs when the number in the text (e.g., `[7]`) does not correspond to the correct source in the numbered reference list at the end of the paper. **Why it's wrong:** This breaks the connection between your claim and its evidence, making it impossible for a reader to find the source. It defeats the entire purpose of citation. Always double-check your numbering.
