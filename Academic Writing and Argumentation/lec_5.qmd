#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Understanding Plagiarism**
**Plagiarism** is the act of presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own without giving proper credit. In academic and professional writing, it is considered a serious offense with significant consequences, including failing an assignment, being reported to a disciplinary board, or even expulsion. A common guideline defines plagiarism as using *more than three words verbatim* from a source without proper referencing.

It's important to distinguish between **plagiarism** and **similarity**. While plagiarism is the uncredited use of another's work, similarity can occur legitimately when citing sources. Tools that detect similarity might flag names, titles, established terminology, numerical data, or common phrases that are difficult to reword. The key difference is *attribution*; properly referenced text may be similar, but it is not plagiarized.

##### **1.2 The Core Principles of Referencing**
**Referencing** is the fundamental method for avoiding plagiarism. It involves systematically acknowledging the sources of information you have used in your writing. Proper referencing allows your readers to locate the original sources, demonstrates the breadth of your research, and situates your work within the existing academic conversation. The two primary components of referencing are in-text citations and a final reference list.

##### **1.3 In-Text Citations (IEEE Style)**
An **in-text citation** is a brief reference within the body of your text that points the reader to the full source details in the reference list. The **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) style** is a numbered system commonly used in technical fields.

Key characteristics of IEEE in-text citations include:

*   **Numbered System:** Citations are numbered in the order they appear in the text, starting with `[1]`.
*   **Square Brackets:** The citation number is always enclosed in square brackets, e.g., `[2]`.
*   **Formatting:** The citation number should appear on the text line, have a space before it, and come *inside* the sentence's punctuation (e.g., "...as shown in the study `[3]`.").
*   **Multiple Sources:** To cite multiple sources at once, separate the numbers with commas (e.g., `[4], [5]`) or use a hyphen for a range (e.g., `[6]-[8]`).
*   ***Et al.***: This Latin phrase, short for *et alia* ("and others"), is used when a source has **more than two authors**. You should list the first author's last name followed by *et al.* For example, a work by Wood, Taylor, and Azzarello would be cited as "Wood *et al.* `[7]` claim that...".

##### **1.4 Direct Quotations and Ellipsis**
A **direct quotation** is an exact, word-for-word reproduction of a phrase or sentence from a source. To use a direct quotation correctly, you must enclose the borrowed text in **quotation marks** and provide an **in-text citation**, including the page number if available (e.g., `[7, p. 14]`). Quotations are used to preserve the original author's precise language or to provide strong evidence for an argument.

An **ellipsis** (a set of three dots, `...`) is used within a quotation to indicate that you have omitted some unnecessary words from the original text. It is crucial that the omission does not alter the original meaning of the source material. For example: "the proposed circuit has improved signal attenuation `...` and has been experiencing less performance degradation."

##### **1.5 The Reference List**
The **reference list** appears at the end of your document and provides the full publication details for every source cited in your text. Each entry is numbered to correspond with the in-text citations. This allows any reader to find the exact sources you consulted. The list should be ordered numerically, matching the sequence of citations in the paper.

##### **1.6 The Art of Summarizing**
**Summarizing** involves condensing the main ideas of a source into a concise overview written in your own words. Unlike a detailed paraphrase, a summary focuses only on the main points, omitting the supporting details. You should summarize when the finer details are irrelevant to your argument or when a source is not significant enough to warrant a more detailed explanation. A summary still requires a citation to the original source.

##### **1.7 Effective Paraphrasing**
**Paraphrasing** is restating information or ideas from a source using *your own vocabulary and sentence structure*. A successful paraphrase demonstrates that you have fully understood the original text. It is different from a quotation because it does not use the author's exact words, and it is different from a summary because it can be just as detailed as the original. Paraphrasing is often preferred over quoting because it improves the flow and readability of your writing while still grounding your arguments in credible sources.

##### **1.8 A 6-Step Guide to Paraphrasing**
To ensure your paraphrase is a true representation of your own understanding and not just a minor rewording of the original, follow these six steps:

1.  **Read the Original:** Read the passage several times until you are confident you understand its meaning.
2.  **Note Key Concepts:** Identify the main ideas and any **shared language**â€”terms that are difficult or impossible to change, such as proper nouns, technical terminology, or numerical data.
3.  **Write from Memory:** Set the original text aside and write your version of the idea. This forces you to use your own words and sentence structure.
4.  **Compare:** Compare your paraphrase with the original passage. Check that you have preserved the original meaning and have not used the same phrasing.
5.  **Revise:** Change any phrases or sentences that are still too similar to the original.
6.  **Cite:** Add an in-text citation (e.g., `[1]`) to give credit to the original author.

##### **1.9 Using Reporting Verbs**
**Reporting verbs** are used to introduce information from a source (e.g., "Smith `[9]` **argues** that..."). The choice of verb is important, as it can convey your stance on the source's idea.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
Instead of relying on overused, neutral verbs like "says" or "states," select a stronger, more precise verb to accurately reflect the author's position and critically evaluate the information. For example, instead of "The study says the result is positive," you could write "The study `celebrates` the positive result" or "The study `concedes` the result is positive." Using varied and accurate reporting verbs makes your writing more dynamic, precise, and analytical. For instance, writing "The Asian Police Alliance `[34]` **blames** the rise in drug trafficking on Western pop culture" is more impactful and specific than saying they **say** it is the cause.

#### **2. Mistakes**

*   **Patchwriting:** This involves changing only a few words in a sentence from a source or rearranging the sentence order slightly. **Why it's wrong:** This is a form of plagiarism because it closely follows the original author's vocabulary and sentence structure without using quotation marks. A proper paraphrase requires you to use your own words and sentence construction.
*   **Incorrect Citation Phrasing:** Using awkward phrasing like "In reference `[1]`, Jones discusses..." or "In Jones `[2]`, a new approach is proposed." **Why it's wrong:** While not technically plagiarism, it is poor academic style. The preferred, more direct phrasing is "Jones `[1]` discusses..." or "Jones `[2]` proposed a new approach...".
*   **Misrepresenting a Source with Ellipsis:** Using an ellipsis (`...`) to omit words in a way that changes the author's original meaning. For example, changing "The study found no significant evidence of a cure" to "The study found `...` evidence of a cure." **Why it's wrong:** This is a serious form of academic dishonesty as it deliberately misleads the reader about the source's findings.
*   **Forgetting to Cite a Summary or Paraphrase:** Assuming that because you used your own words, you don't need to provide a citation. **Why it's wrong:** The ideas or information still belong to the original author. Plagiarism includes using someone's ideas, not just their words, without giving credit.
*   **Mismatching In-Text Citations and the Reference List:** Citing a source in your text (e.g., `[5]`) but forgetting to add the corresponding entry to the numbered reference list at the end of the paper. **Why it's wrong:** This makes it impossible for a reader to find the source you are referencing, defeating the purpose of the citation.
*   **Using Too Many Direct Quotations:** Filling your paper with long, block quotations instead of paraphrasing the information. **Why it's wrong:** Over-quoting suggests that you have not fully understood the material or are unable to explain it in your own words. It makes the writing choppy and less original.
