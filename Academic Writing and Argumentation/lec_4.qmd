#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Defining the Paragraph**

A **paragraph** is the fundamental *basic building block* of any longer text. It is defined as a group of sentences focused entirely on a single subject. The core principle of effective writing dictates that **one paragraph should contain only one idea**. If a new idea or subtopic emerges, a new paragraph must be started.

##### **1.2 Characteristics of an Effective Paragraph**

An effective paragraph must possess five critical characteristics:

1.  **Unified**: It focuses exclusively on *one main idea* (the controlling idea). All sentences must directly develop this central idea without deviation.
2.  **Logical**: The sentences must flow smoothly, establishing clear relationships between concepts. This is often achieved through the **known-new contract**.
3.  **Well-structured**: It follows a recognized format, typically including a head, a body, and a conclusion.
4.  **Clear**: The language and ideas are immediately understandable to the reader.
5.  **Concise**: It is efficient, using only necessary words and sentences to fully develop the idea.

##### **1.3 Paragraph Structure: The Burger Model**

An effective paragraph is usually organized into three distinct parts, often visualized using the **burger analogy**:

1.  **Paragraph Head (Top Bun)**: Typically one or two sentences that introduce the topic and the writer's stance. This is the **topic sentence**.
2.  **Supporting Sentences (Meat and Fillings)**: These form the *body* of the paragraph. They expand, explain, and prove the main idea stated in the head. This section generally makes up two-thirds of the paragraph's word count and requires at least three supporting points.
3.  **Concluding Sentence (Bottom Bun)**: The final sentence that wraps up the discussion of that single idea, often rephrasing the head or summarizing the supporting points.

##### **1.4 The Paragraph Head (Topic Sentence)**

The **Paragraph Head** (or *topic sentence*) is crucial as it states the primary purpose of the paragraph and often provides a smooth transition from the preceding paragraph.

A well-written paragraph head is composed of two elements:

1.  **The Topic**: What the paragraph is generally about.
2.  **The Controlling Idea**: What the writer intends to say or prove about that topic. This limits the scope and dictates what the supporting sentences must discuss.

For example, if the topic is "Video games," the controlling idea might be that "they are beneficial for several reasons." The resulting topic sentence would be: "Video games are beneficial for social, psychological, and physical reasons."

##### **1.5 Writing Supporting Sentences**

Supporting sentences are the *evidence* and *explanation* that develop the controlling idea. They usually follow a two-part approach:

**1. Explanation**
The writer must explain the controlling idea multiple times (usually three) using different approaches, such as providing:

*   **Examples**: Specific instances that illustrate the point.
*   **Reasons**: Causes or justifications for the main idea.
*   **Steps**: If the paragraph describes a process.

**2. Details**
Each explanation must be grounded in **specific details** to provide credibility and depth. Details can take several forms:

*   **Facts**: Information generally accepted as truth.
*   **Anecdotes**: Short, relevant stories or incidents based on experience.
*   **Statistics**: Numerical data, often derived from surveys or studies.
*   **Expert's Opinion**: References to statements or theories from knowledgeable authorities.

##### **1.6 The Concluding Sentence**

The **concluding sentence** is the last sentence in the paragraph and serves to signal the end of the discussion on that particular topic.

***Crucially, it should never introduce new details or ideas.***

There are two main strategies for writing an effective concluding sentence:

1.  **Rephrasing**: Repeating the controlling idea found in the paragraph head, but using entirely different language and syntax.
2.  **Summarizing**: Synthesizing the main points made in the supporting sentences to create a unified final statement.

##### **1.7 Ensuring Logical Flow: Transitions**

For sentences to flow smoothly, they must connect logically. This is managed through two main techniques: the *known-new contract* and the use of *transitions*.

###### **1.7.1 The Known-New Contract (Topic and Stress)**

To maintain logical flow (cohesion), sentences should adhere to the **known-new contract**:

*   **Beginning of the sentence (Topic/Known)**: Start with information the reader already possesses (i.e., information carried over from the previous sentence's ending).
*   **End of the sentence (Stress/New)**: Place the most unfamiliar, important, or *new* information at the end of the sentence.

This creates a chain effect, where the new information (stress) of one sentence becomes the known information (topic) of the next.

###### **1.7.2 Direct Transitions**

**Direct transitions** are specific set phrases or words used to indicate the logical relationship between two sentences or ideas. They help guide the reader through the argument.

*   *Ordering:* First, Second, Finally, Primarily.
*   *Adding:* Furthermore, Moreover, In addition.
*   *Causation:* Therefore, Consequently, As a result.
*   *Contrast:* However, Nevertheless, On the other hand.

###### **1.7.3 Indirect Transitions (Links)**

**Indirect transitions** provide cohesion by linking ideas or words subtly throughout the paragraph:

*   **Word-links**: Simple repetition of key words or phrases (e.g., repeating "Michael Schlotzky" or "student").
*   **Idea-links**: Using synonyms, pronouns, or descriptive phrases to refer back to previously mentioned people, objects, or concepts (e.g., referring to "Michael Schlotzky" as "the young man" or "this truant").

#### **2. Mistakes**

*   **Announcing the topic instead of stating the main idea:** A weak paragraph head often states what the paper *will do* (e.g., "This paper will discuss the difference between A and B"). **Why it's wrong:** The topic sentence should directly state the main argument or conclusion (e.g., "A and B are different") so the reader immediately understands the purpose of the paragraph.
*   **Creating a paragraph head that lacks a controlling idea:** Some topic sentences state only the subject ("The difference between authorization and authentication"). **Why it's wrong:** This fails to limit the scope of the paragraph, leaving the reader unsure of the argument the supporting sentences will develop.
*   **Including sentences that deviate from the main idea (lack of unification):** Inserting information that is interesting but irrelevant to the controlling idea of the paragraph. **Why it's wrong:** This confuses the reader, weakens the argument, and violates the fundamental rule of *one paragraph, one idea*.
*   **Introducing new supporting details in the concluding sentence:** Using the final sentence to provide a new piece of evidence, example, or fact. **Why it's wrong:** The concluding sentence must summarize or rephrase existing content; new details belong in the body of the paragraph and require explanation and development.
*   **Failing to establish a known-new contract across sentences:** Arranging sentences such that the beginning of a sentence introduces an entirely new concept unrelated to the stress of the previous sentence. **Why it's wrong:** This makes the prose choppy and difficult to follow, breaking the logical chain of thought for the reader.
*   **Using insufficient supporting sentences:** Writing a paragraph with only one or two brief supporting sentences to prove the controlling idea. **Why it's wrong:** The main idea remains underdeveloped, unsubstantiated, and unconvincing. An effective paragraph requires several well-detailed supporting sentences (at least three) to fully develop the argument.
