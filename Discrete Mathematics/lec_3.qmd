#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 From Propositions to Predicates**
In logic, a **proposition** is a declarative statement that is definitively either *true* or *false*, but not both. For instance, "The number 4 is an even number" is a true proposition. However, we often need to work with statements whose truth value depends on a variable, such as "x is an even number."

This is where **predicates** come in. A **predicate** is a statement containing one or more variables, which becomes a proposition once the variables are replaced with specific values. We can represent the predicate "x is an even number" as $P(x)$. When we set $x=4$, $P(4)$ becomes the true proposition "4 is an even number." The set of all possible values a variable can take is called the **domain**. The truth of a predicate statement *critically depends on its domain*.

##### **1.2 Quantifiers: Generalizing Predicates**
Quantifiers are symbols that allow us to make general claims about the truth of a predicate over its entire domain, without having to test every single value. There are two primary quantifiers.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.2.1 The Universal Quantifier ($\forall$)**
The **universal quantifier**, denoted by the symbol $\forall$, stands for "for all" or "for any." The statement $\forall x P(x)$ asserts that the predicate $P(x)$ is true for *every single element* $x$ in the domain.

*   **Example**: If the domain is the set of all even numbers, the statement $\forall x (\text{"x is divisible by 2"})$ is true.
*   **Connection to Logic**: For a *finite domain* $\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$, the universal statement $\forall x P(x)$ is logically equivalent to the conjunction (AND) of the predicate for each element: $P(x_1) \land P(x_2) \land \dots \land P(x_n)$. A universal statement is only true if *all* parts are true.

###### **1.2.2 The Existential Quantifier ($\exists$)**
The **existential quantifier**, denoted by the symbol $\exists$, stands for "there exists" or "for some." The statement $\exists x P(x)$ asserts that there is *at least one element* $x$ in the domain for which the predicate $P(x)$ is true.

*   **Example**: If the domain is the set of all integers, the statement $\exists x (x^2 = 9)$ is true, because we can find at least one value (namely, 3 or -3) that makes it true.
*   **Connection to Logic**: For a *finite domain* $\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$, the existential statement $\exists x P(x)$ is logically equivalent to the disjunction (OR) of the predicate for each element: $P(x_1) \lor P(x_2) \lor \dots \lor P(x_n)$. An existential statement is true if *at least one* part is true.

##### **1.3 Free and Bound Variables**
In a logical formula, a variable can be either **bound** or **free**.

*   A variable is **bound** if it is within the scope of a quantifier. In the expression $\forall x (x > y)$, the variable `x` is bound by the universal quantifier.
*   A variable is **free** if it is not bound by any quantifier. In the same expression, $\forall x (x > y)$, the variable `y` is free.

A formula with no free variables is a proposition; its truth value can be determined (given a domain). A formula with free variables is a predicate; its truth value depends on the values assigned to the free variables.

##### **1.4 Interpretation and Counterexamples**
*   An **interpretation** is an assignment of a specific domain and meanings to the predicates in a formula that makes the formula **TRUE**.
*   A **counterexample** is an interpretation that makes the formula **FALSE**. Finding even a single case in the domain that violates a universal statement serves as a counterexample. For instance, to disprove $\forall x (\text{"x is an odd number"})$ for the domain of integers, we only need to provide one counterexample, like the number 2, which is an integer but not odd.

##### **1.5 De Morgan's Laws for Quantifiers**
De Morgan's Laws provide a crucial relationship between negation and quantifiers, allowing us to move the negation symbol (`¬`) inside a quantifier by flipping the quantifier.

1.  **Negating a Universal Quantifier**: The negation of "for all x, P(x) is true" is "there exists an x for which P(x) is false."
    $$ \neg \forall x P(x) \equiv \exists x \neg P(x) $$
    *Analogy*: To disprove the claim "All students passed the exam," you only need to find one student who did not pass.

2.  **Negating an Existential Quantifier**: The negation of "there exists an x for which P(x) is true" is "for all x, P(x) is false."
    $$ \neg \exists x P(x) \equiv \forall x \neg P(x) $$
    *Analogy*: To disprove the claim "There is a dragon in the castle," you must check every room and confirm that all of them are dragon-free.

##### **1.6 Properties of Quantifiers**
Quantifiers interact with logical connectives like AND (`&`) and OR (`∨`) in specific ways.

*   **Universal Quantifier and AND**: A universal quantifier can be distributed over `&`. The statement "all x have property P and property R" is the same as "all x have property P" AND "all x have property R".
    $$ \forall x (P(x) \land R(x)) \equiv \forall x P(x) \land \forall x R(x) $$
*   **Existential Quantifier and OR**: An existential quantifier can be distributed over `∨`. The statement "there is an x that has property P or property R" is the same as "there is an x with property P" OR "there is an x with property R".
    $$ \exists x (P(x) \lor R(x)) \equiv \exists x P(x) \lor \exists x R(x) $$
*   *Important Note*: A universal quantifier cannot be distributed over `∨`, and an existential quantifier cannot be distributed over `&`.

##### **1.7 Nested Quantifiers**
Nested quantifiers occur when one quantifier is within the scope of another, such as $\forall x \exists y (x+y=0)$. The order of quantifiers is critical.

*   **Same Quantifiers**: If the quantifiers are the same, their order does not matter.
    $$ \forall x \forall y P(x, y) \equiv \forall y \forall x P(x, y) $$
    $$ \exists x \exists y P(x, y) \equiv \exists y \exists x P(x, y) $$
*   **Mixed Quantifiers**: If the quantifiers are different, their order *does* matter and can completely change the meaning of the statement.
    $$ \exists x \forall y P(x, y) \rightarrow \forall y \exists x P(x, y) $$
    The statement on the left implies the one on the right, but the reverse is not true. Let's analyze $\exists x \forall y$ versus $\forall y \exists x$:
    *   $\exists x \forall y P(x,y)$: "There exists a single `x` that works for all `y`." This is a very strong claim. For example, if $P(x,y)$ is "$x \geq y$" in the domain of natural numbers, this is false. There is no single natural number that is greater than or equal to all other natural numbers.
    *   $\forall y \exists x P(x,y)$: "For any given `y`, we can find some `x` that works." The choice of `x` can depend on `y`. For the same example, "$x \geq y$", this is true. For any natural number `y`, we can always find an `x` (e.g., `x=y` or `x=y+1`) that is greater than or equal to it.

##### **1.8 Special Quantifiers**
For convenience, we use extensions of the standard quantifiers.

*   **Uniqueness Quantifier ($\exists!$)**: The statement $\exists!x P(x)$ means "there exists a *unique* (one and only one) x such that $P(x)$ is true."
*   **Restricted Quantifiers**: We often restrict the domain of a quantifier to a certain condition.
    *   **Restricted Universal**: $\forall x > 0, P(x)$ means "for all x that are greater than 0, $P(x)$ is true." This is formally written as an implication:
        $$ \forall x (x > 0 \rightarrow P(x)) $$
    *   **Restricted Existential**: $\exists x > 0, P(x)$ means "there exists an x greater than 0 such that $P(x)$ is true." This is formally written as a conjunction:
        $$ \exists x (x > 0 \land P(x)) $$

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Set**: An unordered collection of distinct elements.
*   **Proposition**: A declarative sentence that is unambiguously true or false.
*   **Predicate**: A sentence containing variables that becomes a proposition when the variables are assigned specific values from a domain.
*   **Domain**: The set of all possible values that a variable in a predicate can assume.
*   **Universal Quantifier ($\forall$)**: A logical symbol meaning "for all" or "for every," asserting that a predicate is true for all elements in the domain.
*   **Existential Quantifier ($\exists$)**: A logical symbol meaning "there exists" or "for some," asserting that a predicate is true for at least one element in the domain.
*   **Bound Variable**: A variable that falls within the scope of a quantifier.
*   **Free Variable**: A variable in a logical formula that is not bound by a quantifier.
*   **Interpretation**: An assignment of a domain and meanings to predicates that makes a formula TRUE.
*   **Counterexample**: An assignment of a domain and meanings to predicates that makes a formula FALSE.

#### **3. Formulas**

*   **De Morgan's Law for $\forall$**: $\neg \forall x P(x) \equiv \exists x \neg P(x)$
*   **De Morgan's Law for $\exists$**: $\neg \exists x P(x) \equiv \forall x \neg P(x)$
*   **Distribution of $\forall$ over $\land$**: $\forall x (P(x) \land R(x)) \equiv \forall x P(x) \land \forall x R(x)$
*   **Distribution of $\exists$ over $\lor$**: $\exists x (P(x) \lor R(x)) \equiv \exists x P(x) \lor \exists x R(x)$
*   **Commutativity of Same Quantifiers**:
    *   $\forall x \forall y P(x, y) \equiv \forall y \forall x P(x, y)$
    *   $\exists x \exists y P(x, y) \equiv \exists y \exists x P(x, y)$
*   **Implication of Mixed Quantifiers**: $\exists x \forall y P(x, y) \rightarrow \forall y \exists x P(x, y)$
*   **Uniqueness Quantifier Definition**: $\exists!x P(x) \equiv \exists x (P(x) \land \forall y (P(y) \rightarrow y=x))$
*   **Restricted Universal Quantifier**: The statement "For all $x$ such that $R(x)$, $P(x)$ holds" is written as $\forall x (R(x) \rightarrow P(x))$.
*   **Restricted Existential Quantifier**: The statement "There exists an $x$ such that $R(x)$ and $P(x)$" is written as $\exists x (R(x) \land P(x))$.

#### **4. Mistakes**

*   **Confusing the order of mixed quantifiers:** Treating $\forall x \exists y P(x,y)$ and $\exists y \forall x P(x,y)$ as equivalent. **Why it's wrong:** The order changes the meaning entirely. $\exists y \forall x$ implies a single `y` must work for all `x`, a much stronger condition than $\forall x \exists y$, where `y` can be chosen differently for each `x`.
*   **Incorrectly distributing quantifiers:** Assuming that $\forall x (P(x) \lor R(x))$ is the same as $\forall x P(x) \lor \forall x R(x)$. **Why it's wrong:** Consider the domain of integers where $P(x)$ is "x is even" and $R(x)$ is "x is odd". Every integer is either even or odd, so $\forall x (P(x) \lor R(x))$ is true. However, it's not true that all integers are even, and it's not true that all integers are odd, so $\forall x P(x) \lor \forall x R(x)$ is false.
*   **Applying the wrong logical connective for restricted quantifiers:** Using `&` with a restricted universal quantifier, like $\forall x (x>0 \land P(x))$. **Why it's wrong:** This would mean "for all x, x is positive AND P(x) is true," which is a much stronger and usually incorrect statement. A universal restriction requires an implication (`→`). Similarly, using `→` with a restricted existential quantifier is wrong because it can be trivially true if the condition is false.
*   **Using an incorrect De Morgan's Law:** Negating $\forall x P(x)$ to become $\forall x \neg P(x)$. **Why it's wrong:** This mistake ignores the rule that the quantifier must flip. The correct negation is $\exists x \neg P(x)$. Negating "everyone passed" does not mean "everyone failed"; it means "at least one person failed."
*   **Forgetting the Domain:** Evaluating the truth of a statement without considering the specified domain. **Why it's wrong:** The statement $\forall x (x > 0)$ is true if the domain is positive integers but false if the domain is all integers. The domain is fundamental to the meaning of a quantified statement.

#### **5. Examples**

##### **5.1. Translating Logic to English**

1.  **Identify the main quantifier and structure**: The main structure is a universal quantifier $\forall x$ applied to an implication $R(x) \rightarrow P(x)$.
2.  **Translate the universal quantifier**: $\forall x$ means "For every person x...".
3.  **Translate the implication**: $R(x) \rightarrow P(x)$ means "If x knows C++, then x likes oranges".
4.  **Combine the parts**: "For every person x, if x knows C++, then x likes oranges."
5.  **Refine into natural English**: This can be stated more naturally.

**Answer:** **Everyone who knows C++ also likes oranges.**

##### **5.2. Determining Truth Value**
**Question:** Let the domain be all real numbers. Determine the truth value of the statement $\forall x \exists y (x + y = 0)$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Read the statement**: The statement says "For any real number `x`, there exists some real number `y` such that their sum is 0."
2.  **Test the logic**: Let's pick an arbitrary real number for `x`, say $x=5$. Can we find a `y` such that $5+y=0$? Yes, $y=-5$.
3.  **Generalize the test**: For any arbitrary real number `x`, we can choose $y = -x$. Since the negative of any real number is also a real number, we can always find such a `y`.
4.  **Conclusion**: Since we can find a suitable `y` for every possible `x`, the statement is true.

**Answer:** **TRUE.**
</details>

##### **5.3. Applying De Morgan's Laws**
**Question:** Rewrite the statement $\neg \forall x \exists y ((x > 0) \land (y < 0))$ so that no negation is outside a quantifier or a logical connective.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Apply De Morgan's Law to the outermost quantifier ($\forall x$)**: Move the negation inside by flipping $\forall$ to $\exists$.
    $$ \exists x \neg (\exists y ((x > 0) \land (y < 0))) $$
2.  **Apply De Morgan's Law to the next quantifier ($\exists y$)**: Move the negation inside by flipping $\exists$ to $\forall$.
    $$ \exists x \forall y \neg ((x > 0) \land (y < 0)) $$
3.  **Apply De Morgan's Law to the logical connective ($\land$)**: The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations: $\neg(A \land B) \equiv \neg A \lor \neg B$.
    $$ \exists x \forall y (\neg(x > 0) \lor \neg(y < 0)) $$
4.  **Simplify the final inequalities**: $\neg(x > 0)$ is $x \le 0$, and $\neg(y < 0)$ is $y \ge 0$.
    $$ \exists x \forall y ((x \le 0) \lor (y \ge 0)) $$

**Answer:** **$\exists x \forall y ((x \le 0) \lor (y \ge 0))$**
</details>

##### **5.4. Finding Domains for Truth and Falsity**
**Question:** Find a non-empty domain for `x` and `y` where the statement $\exists x \forall y (xy = y)$ is true, and a domain where it is false.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Analyze the statement**: It says "There exists a single number `x` such that for every number `y` in the domain, multiplying `x` by `y` results in `y`." This means `x` must be the multiplicative identity.

2.  **Find a domain where it is TRUE**:
    *   The multiplicative identity is 1. If the number 1 is in our domain, we can choose $x=1$.
    *   Let's test if $x=1$ works for all `y`. If we choose the domain to be the set of all integers, then for $x=1$, it is true that $1 \cdot y = y$ for any integer `y`.
    *   So, a valid domain is the set of integers, real numbers, or any set containing 1. A simpler domain is just $\{1\}$. If the domain is $\{1\}$, then $x=1$ and $y=1$, and $1 \cdot 1 = 1$, which is true.

3.  **Find a domain where it is FALSE**:
    *   For the statement to be false, there must be no such `x` in the domain.
    *   This means the domain should not contain the multiplicative identity (1).
    *   Let's choose the domain to be the set $\{2, 3\}$.
    *   Test $x=2$: Does $2y=y$ for all $y \in \{2, 3\}$? No, $2 \cdot 3 = 6 \neq 3$.
    *   Test $x=3$: Does $3y=y$ for all $y \in \{2, 3\}$? No, $3 \cdot 2 = 6 \neq 2$.
    *   Since neither possible value for `x` works for all `y`, the statement is false in this domain.

**Answer:**
*   **TRUE Domain:** The set of all real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$.
*   **FALSE Domain:** The set $\{2, 3\}$.
</details>

##### **5.5. Nested Quantifiers with Counterexample**
**Question:** Let the domain be the set of integers $\{0, 1, 2\}$. Determine the truth value of $\forall x \forall y ((x \ne y) \rightarrow \forall z ((z=x) \lor (z=y)))$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Analyze the statement**: "For any two distinct elements `x` and `y` from the domain, every element `z` in the domain must be equal to either `x` or `y`."
2.  **Identify the condition**: The statement has an implication. It only makes a claim when the hypothesis ($x \ne y$) is true. We need to find a pair `x`, `y` from $\{0, 1, 2\}$ where $x \ne y$.
3.  **Select a counterexample pair**: Let's choose $x=0$ and $y=1$. The hypothesis $x \ne y$ is true.
4.  **Test the conclusion for this pair**: The conclusion is $\forall z ((z=x) \lor (z=y))$, which for our chosen pair means $\forall z \in \{0, 1, 2\}, ((z=0) \lor (z=1))$.
5.  **Evaluate the conclusion**: Is it true that every `z` in $\{0, 1, 2\}$ is either 0 or 1?
    *   For $z=0$: $(0=0 \lor 0=1)$ is TRUE.
    *   For $z=1$: $(1=0 \lor 1=1)$ is TRUE.
    *   For $z=2$: $(2=0 \lor 2=1)$ is FALSE.
6.  **Final Conclusion**: Since the conclusion is false for $z=2$, the universal statement $\forall z ((z=0) \lor (z=1))$ is false. Because we found a pair ($x=0, y=1$) for which the hypothesis is true but the conclusion is false, the original implication-based statement is false.

**Answer:** **FALSE.**
</details>

##### **5.6. Rewriting a Restricted Quantifier**
**Question:** Rewrite the statement "There exists an integer `i` in the set $\{1, ..., 10\}$ such that $P(i)$" using standard quantifiers and logical connectives.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Identify the type of restricted quantifier**: This is a restricted *existential* quantifier.
2.  **Recall the formal definition**: A statement of the form "There exists an `x` with property $R(x)$ such that $P(x)$" is written as $\exists x (R(x) \land P(x))$.
3.  **Apply the definition**:
    *   The variable is `i`.
    *   The restricting property $R(i)$ is "$i \in \{1, ..., 10\}$".
    *   The main property $P(i)$ is just $P(i)$.
4.  **Combine the parts**: Substitute into the formal structure.

**Answer:** **$\exists i (i \in \{1, ..., 10\} \land P(i))$**
</details>

##### **5.7. Truth Value of Uniqueness Quantifier**
**Question:** Let the domain be the set of real numbers. Determine the truth value of $\exists!x ((x > 0) \land (x^2 = 16))$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Analyze the statement**: The uniqueness quantifier $\exists!x$ means "There exists one and only one `x`". The predicate is "$x$ is positive AND $x^2 = 16$".
2.  **Find all values that satisfy the predicate**: We need to find all real numbers `x` that satisfy both conditions.
3.  **Solve the equation**: The solutions to $x^2 = 16$ are $x = 4$ and $x = -4$.
4.  **Apply the condition**: We must also satisfy the condition $x > 0$.
    *   For $x=4$: Is $4 > 0$? Yes. So $x=4$ is a solution.
    *   For $x=-4$: Is $-4 > 0$? No. So $x=-4$ is not a solution.
5.  **Count the solutions**: We found exactly one value, $x=4$, that satisfies the entire predicate.
6.  **Conclusion**: Since there is one and only one solution, the uniqueness statement is true.

**Answer:** **TRUE.**
