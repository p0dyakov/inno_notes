#### **1. Summary**
##### **1.1 Implicit vs. Explicit Functions**
###### **1.1.1 Explicit Functions**
Most functions you encounter in early calculus are *explicit*, meaning one variable is directly expressed in terms of another. For example, in the function $y = x^2$, `y` is explicitly defined as a function of `x`. For any given input `x`, you can directly calculate the output `y`.

###### **1.1.2 Implicit Relations**
Some relationships between variables are not written this way. Consider the equation of a circle with a radius of 5: $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. This is an **implicit equation**. Here, `y` is not isolated on one side. While you could solve for `y` to get $y = \pm\sqrt{25 - x^2}$, this creates two separate functions. The original equation defines the entire curve with a single relationship where `x` and `y` are interdependent. Think of `x` and `y` as two values linked by a rule, rather than one being a direct input and the other an output.

##### **1.2 Finding the Slope of an Implicit Curve**
Even if a curve isn't a function, we can still find the slope of its tangent line ($dy/dx$) at a given point using **implicit differentiation**. The core idea is to treat `y` as a function of `x` (even if we can't write it down) and apply the chain rule.

Let's use the circle equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. To find the slope, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to `x`.

1.  **Differentiate the `x` term:** The derivative of $x^2$ with respect to `x` is simply $2x$.
2.  **Differentiate the `y` term:** This is the key step. Since we're assuming `y` depends on `x`, we must use the *chain rule*. The derivative of $y^2$ with respect to `x` is $2y$ (the derivative of the outer function) multiplied by the derivative of `y` with respect to `x`, which is $dy/dx$. So, we get $2y \frac{dy}{dx}$.
3.  **Differentiate the constant:** The derivative of the constant 25 is 0.

Putting it all together, we have:
$$ 2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 $$

Now, we can algebraically solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$:
$$ 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = -2x $$
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{2x}{2y} = -\frac{x}{y} $$

This formula gives us the slope of the tangent line at any point $(x, y)$ on the circle. For instance, at the point (3, 4), the slope is $-\frac{3}{4}$.

##### **1.3 Connection to Related Rates**
Implicit differentiation is conceptually linked to **related rates** problems. In related rates, multiple variables are functions of a common variable, usually time `t`.

Imagine a 5-meter ladder leaning against a wall. The distance from the base of the wall to the ladder's bottom is `x(t)`, and the height of the ladder's top is `y(t)`. The Pythagorean theorem tells us that at any time `t`:
$$ (x(t))^2 + (y(t))^2 = 5^2 $$

If we know the rate at which the ladder is sliding down the wall ($dy/dt$) and want to find the rate at which its base is moving away ($dx/dt$), we can differentiate the entire equation with respect to `t`.

Applying the chain rule to both `x(t)` and `y(t)` yields:
$$ 2x(t)\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y(t)\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 $$

This equation relates the variables (`x` and `y`) to their rates of change ($dx/dt$ and $dy/dt$). This process is the same as implicit differentiation, but with respect to time `t` instead of `x`.

#### **2. Definitions**
*   **Implicit Differentiation**: A method used to find the derivative of a variable in an implicit equation by differentiating both sides with respect to that variable and applying the chain rule.
*   **Implicit Equation**: An equation involving two or more variables where one variable is not explicitly expressed in terms of the others (e.g., $x^2 + y^2 = 25$).
*   **Explicit Function**: A function where the dependent variable is expressed solely in terms of the independent variable (e.g., $y = x^2$).
*   **Related Rates**: Problems that involve finding the rate of change of one quantity by relating it to other quantities whose rates of change are known. The rates are typically with respect to time.

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **The Chain Rule for Implicit Differentiation**: When differentiating a term with `y` with respect to `x`, if $y$ is a function of $x$, then $\frac{d}{dx}[f(y)] = f'(y) \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}$.
*   **General Derivative of an Implicit Equation**: Given an equation $F(x, y) = C$, its derivative is found by applying $\frac{d}{dx}$ to both sides: $\frac{d}{dx}[F(x, y)] = 0$.
*   **Derivative of a Circle**: For a circle defined by $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, the slope of the tangent line is $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}$.

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Forgetting the Chain Rule for `y`**: A common error is differentiating a term like $y^3$ with respect to `x` and writing $3y^2$ instead of the correct $3y^2 \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}$. **Why it's wrong**: Since `y` is treated as an inner function of `x`, the chain rule is mandatory.
*   **Incorrectly Differentiating a Product**: Forgetting to use the product rule for terms like $xy$. The derivative of $xy$ is not simply $\frac{dy}{dx}$. **Why it's wrong**: $xy$ is a product of two functions of `x` (`x` and `y(x)`), so the product rule must be used: $1 \cdot y + x \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}$.
*   **Algebraic Mistakes**: After correctly differentiating, simple errors can be made when isolating $\frac{dy}{dx}$.
*   **Differentiating Constants as Non-Zero**: Forgetting that the derivative of any constant (like 25 in $x^2 + y^2 = 25$) is zero.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Differentiate both sides with respect to `x`:**
    $$ \frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + y^3) = \frac{d}{dx}(6xy) $$
2.  **Apply differentiation rules:**
    - Left side: $3x^2 + 3y^2\frac{dy}{dx}$
    - Right side (use product rule on $xy$): $6(1 \cdot y + x \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}) = 6y + 6x\frac{dy}{dx}$
3.  **Set them equal and solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$:**
    $$ 3x^2 + 3y^2\frac{dy}{dx} = 6y + 6x\frac{dy}{dx} $$
    $$ 3y^2\frac{dy}{dx} - 6x\frac{dy}{dx} = 6y - 3x^2 $$
    $$ \frac{dy}{dx}(3y^2 - 6x) = 6y - 3x^2 $$
    $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{6y - 3x^2}{3y^2 - 6x} = \frac{2y - x^2}{y^2 - 2x} $$

**Answer:** $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2y - x^2}{y^2 - 2x}$

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Differentiate both sides with respect to `x`:**
    $$ \frac{d}{dx}(\sin(x) + \cos(y)) = \frac{d}{dx}(1) $$
2.  **Apply differentiation rules (using chain rule for $\cos(y)$):**

3.  **Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$:**
    $$ -\sin(y)\frac{dy}{dx} = -\cos(x) $$

<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find the slope using implicit differentiation:**
    $$ \frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 3x + 3) $$
    $$ 2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 3 $$
    $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2 - 3}{2y} $$
2.  **Calculate the slope at $(1, 1)$:**
    $$ m = \frac{3(1)^2 - 3}{2(1)} = \frac{3 - 3}{2} = 0 $$
3.  **Use the point-slope form to find the line's equation:**
    $$ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) $$
    $$ y - 1 = 0(x - 1) $$
    $$ y - 1 = 0 \implies y = 1 $$

##### **5.5 Find the Second Derivative**
**Question:** Find $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ for $x^2 + y^2 = 25$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **First, find the first derivative, $\frac{dy}{dx}$:**
    We already found this in a previous example: $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}$.
2.  **Differentiate $\frac{dy}{dx}$ with respect to `x` using the quotient rule:**
    $$ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{d}{dx}\left(-\frac{x}{y}\right) = -\frac{(1 \cdot y) - (x \cdot \frac{dy}{dx})}{y^2} $$
    $$ = -\frac{y - x\frac{dy}{dx}}{y^2} $$
3.  **Substitute the expression for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ back into the equation:**
    $$ = -\frac{y - x(-\frac{x}{y})}{y^2} = -\frac{y + \frac{x^2}{y}}{y^2} $$
4.  **Simplify the complex fraction:**
    $$ = -\frac{\frac{y^2 + x^2}{y}}{y^2} = -\frac{x^2 + y^2}{y^3} $$
5.  **Substitute the original relation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$:**
    $$ = -\frac{25}{y^3} $$

**Answer:** $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -\frac{25}{y^3}$

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Differentiate both sides with respect to `x`. Use the product rule on the left side:**
    $$ \frac{d}{dx}(x \cdot e^y) = \frac{d}{dx}(y) $$
    $$ (1 \cdot e^y) + (x \cdot e^y \frac{dy}{dx}) = \frac{dy}{dx} $$
2.  **Gather terms with $\frac{dy}{dx}$ on one side:**
    $$ e^y = \frac{dy}{dx} - x e^y \frac{dy}{dx} $$
    $$ e^y = \frac{dy}{dx}(1 - x e^y) $$
3.  **Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$:**
    $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{e^y}{1 - x e^y} $$

**Answer:** $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{e^y}{1 - x e^y}$

##### **5.7 Related Rates Problem**
**Question:** A spherical balloon is being inflated. Its volume `V` is increasing at a rate of $100 \text{ cm}^3/\text{s}$. At what rate is the radius `r` increasing when the radius is 10 cm? (The volume of a sphere is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$).
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Identify the given information and what needs to be found:**
    - Given: $\frac{dV}{dt} = 100 \text{ cm}^3/\text{s}$
    - Find: $\frac{dr}{dt}$ when $r = 10 \text{ cm}$
2.  **Write the equation that relates the variables:**
    $$ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 $$
3.  **Differentiate both sides with respect to time `t`:**
    $$ \frac{d}{dt}(V) = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\right) $$
    $$ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{4}{3}\pi \cdot (3r^2 \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}) $$
    $$ \frac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt} $$
4.  **Substitute the known values and solve for $\frac{dr}{dt}$:**
    $$ 100 = 4\pi (10)^2 \frac{dr}{dt} $$
    $$ 100 = 400\pi \frac{dr}{dt} $$
    $$ \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{100}{400\pi} = \frac{1}{4\pi} $$

**Answer:** The radius is increasing at a rate of **$\frac{1}{4\pi} \text{ cm/s}$**.
