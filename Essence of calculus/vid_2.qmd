#### **1. Summary**
##### **1.1 Introduction to Derivatives**
The primary goal of differential calculus is to understand the concept of a **derivative**. This idea, while seemingly simple, has many subtleties and can lead to paradoxes if not handled carefully. A secondary goal is to appreciate these potential paradoxes and learn how to avoid them through a rigorous understanding of the topic.

##### **1.2 The Paradox of "Instantaneous Rate of Change"**
###### **1.2.1 The Oxymoron**
It is common to hear the derivative described as measuring an **"instantaneous rate of change."** However, this phrase is an oxymoron.

-   A **rate of change** is a concept that inherently requires comparing values at multiple points in time to see how a quantity has changed.
-   An **instant** refers to a single, frozen point in time.

Within a single, durationless instant, there is no opportunity for change to occur. Trying to describe a "rate of change" at an "instant" is a logical contradiction.

###### **1.2.2 The Fathers of Calculus**
This fundamental paradox was grappled with by the creators of calculus. Early pioneers like Isaac Barrow, Isaac Newton, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz discovered the core ideas and intuitions. Later, mathematicians like Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass provided the rigorous logical foundations, including the concept of **limits**, to resolve these paradoxes and make calculus a sound mathematical discipline.

##### **1.3 A Real-World Example: Car Motion**
To understand derivatives, consider a practical example: a car accelerating from a starting point A and then decelerating to a stop at point B, 100 meters away, over a total of 10 seconds. This motion can be represented on a graph.

-   The **vertical axis** represents the distance traveled, `s`, in meters.
-   The **horizontal axis** represents the time elapsed, `t`, in seconds.
-   The function `s(t)` gives the total distance traveled at any given time `t`.

The shape of the curve illustrates the car's speed. Where the curve is shallow, the car is slow. Where the curve is steep, the car is fast. This visual steepness is directly related to the car's **velocity**.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

##### **1.4 Velocity and Its Calculation**
Velocity is defined as the change in distance over the change in time. To calculate velocity, one must compare the distance traveled between two distinct points in time. For instance, to find the average velocity between `t = 4` seconds and `t = 5` seconds, we would calculate:
$$ \text{Velocity} = \frac{\text{Change in distance}}{\text{Change in time}} = \frac{s(5) - s(4)}{5 - 4} $$
It is impossible to determine the velocity of an object from a single snapshot in time, as there is no change to measure.

##### **1.5 The Derivative as a Limit**
The central idea of a derivative is to resolve the paradox of an "instantaneous" rate of change. It does this by asking what the average rate of change approaches as the time interval becomes infinitesimally small.

-   We use the notation `dt` to represent a small change (or "nudge") in time.
-   The corresponding change in distance is denoted as `ds`.
-   The ratio `ds/dt` gives the average velocity over that tiny interval `dt`.

The **derivative** of the function `s(t)` is the value that this ratio `ds/dt` approaches as `dt` gets closer and closer to zero. This process of finding what a value approaches is called finding a **limit**.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

##### **1.6 Geometric Interpretation: Slope of the Tangent Line**
Graphically, the ratio `ds/dt` represents the slope of a line connecting two nearby points on the graph of `s(t)`. This line is called a **secant line**.

As the time interval `dt` approaches zero, the two points on the graph get closer and closer together. The secant line connecting them approaches a line that just touches the graph at that single point. This line is the **tangent line**. The slope of this tangent line is the derivative of the function at that point.

Thus, the derivative provides the best constant approximation for the rate of change at a specific point.

##### **1.7 An Algebraic Example: `s(t) = t³`**
Let's find the derivative of the function `s(t) = t³` at the specific time `t = 2`.

1.  **Set up the ratio:**
    $$ \frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{s(2 + dt) - s(2)}{dt} $$
2.  **Substitute the function `t³`:**
    $$ \frac{(2 + dt)^3 - 2^3}{dt} $$
3.  **Expand the numerator:**
    Recalling that $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$, we get:
    $$ \frac{(2^3 + 3(2^2)(dt) + 3(2)(dt)^2 + (dt)^3) - 2^3}{dt} $$
4.  **Simplify:**
    The $2^3$ terms cancel. We can then divide the entire expression by `dt`.
    $$ \frac{3(2^2)(dt) + 3(2)(dt)^2 + (dt)^3}{dt} = 3(2^2) + 3(2)(dt) + (dt)^2 $$
5.  **Find the limit:**
    Now, we consider what happens as `dt` approaches 0. All terms containing `dt` will vanish.
    $$ \lim_{dt \to 0} [3(2^2) + 6(dt) + (dt)^2] = 3(2^2) = 12 $$
So, the derivative of `t³` at `t = 2` is 12. More generally, the derivative function for `s(t) = t³` is `ds/dt = 3t²`.

#### **2. Definitions**
*   **Derivative**: The value that the ratio of the change in a function's output (`ds`) to a small change in its input (`dt`) approaches as the change in the input (`dt`) approaches zero. Geometrically, it is the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at a point.
*   **Instantaneous Rate of Change**: A conceptual idea for the rate of change at a single point in time. Mathematically, it is defined by the derivative.
*   **Limit**: The value that a function approaches as its input approaches a certain value. The core concept that resolves the paradox of the derivative.
*   **Tangent Line**: A straight line that touches a curve at a single point and has the same slope as the curve at that point.
*   **Secant Line**: A straight line connecting two distinct points on a curve.

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **Average Rate of Change**:
    $$ \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} = \frac{s(t_2) - s(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1} $$
*   **Derivative (Limit Definition)**:
    $$ \frac{ds}{dt}(t) = \lim_{dt \to 0} \frac{s(t + dt) - s(t)}{dt} $$
*   **Derivative of `t³` (Power Rule Example)**:
    $$ \frac{d}{dt}(t^3) = 3t^2 $$

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Treating `dt` as literally zero**: In the derivative expression `ds/dt`, dividing by `dt` is a key step. You cannot divide by zero. The concept is about what happens as `dt` *approaches* zero, not what happens when it *is* zero.
*   **Confusing the derivative with an average rate of change**: The derivative is the *limit* of the average rate of change as the interval shrinks, not the rate over a fixed interval like 0.01 seconds.
*   **Believing "instantaneous rate of change" is a literal concept**: Change requires a time interval. The derivative is a sophisticated mathematical tool to define the best constant approximation of a changing rate at a single point, resolving this paradox.
*   **Thinking the derivative must be complex**: While the limit definition can be algebraically intensive, the final derivative function (e.g., `3t²`) is often much simpler than the original ratio.

#### **5. Examples**

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Write the limit expression for the derivative:**
    $$ \frac{ds}{dt}(1) = \lim_{dt \to 0} \frac{s(1 + dt) - s(1)}{dt} $$
2.  **Substitute `s(t) = t³`:**

</details>

##### **5.3. Slope of the Tangent Line**
**Question:** What is the slope of the line tangent to the graph of `y = x³` at the point `x = 4`?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

The slope of the tangent line is given by the derivative. The derivative of `f(x) = x³` is `f'(x) = 3x²`.

2.  **Calculate the value:**
    $$ s'(5) = 3(25) = 75 $$

</details>

##### **5.5. The Zeno Paradox**
**Question:** At `t = 0`, the derivative of `s(t) = t³` is `s'(0) = 3(0)² = 0`. Does this mean the car is not moving? If so, how does it ever start moving?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
This is a classic paradox of calculus.

1.  **The Derivative's Meaning**: The derivative being zero at `t = 0` means that the best *constant* approximation for the car's velocity around that instant is 0 m/s. It does not mean the car is absolutely static for any duration of time.
2.  **Movement over an Interval**: For any small time interval after `t = 0` (e.g., from `t = 0` to `t = 0.01`), the car *does* move. Its position changes from `s(0)=0` to `s(0.01) = 0.000001`. The average velocity over this interval is not zero.
3.  **Resolution**: The paradox is resolved by understanding that the derivative describes a *limit*—the behavior *approaching* an instant, not the behavior *at* a durationless instant. Although its instantaneous rate of change is zero, its rate of change is itself changing (this relates to the second derivative, or acceleration), allowing it to move in the very next moment.

**Answer:** The car's velocity is 0 at the exact instant `t = 0`, but it begins moving immediately after because its velocity is changing.
</details>

##### **5.6. Approximating Instantaneous Velocity**
**Question:** Approximate the instantaneous velocity of `s(t) = t³` at `t = 2` by calculating the average velocity over the interval `[2, 2.01]`.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Calculate the change in distance `Δs`:**
    $$ \Delta s = s(2.01) - s(2) = (2.01)^3 - 2^3 $$
    $$ \Delta s = 8.120601 - 8 = 0.120601 \text{ meters} $$
2.  **Identify the change in time `Δt`:**
    $$ \Delta t = 2.01 - 2 = 0.01 \text{ seconds} $$
3.  **Calculate the average velocity:**
    $$ \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} = \frac{0.120601}{0.01} = 12.0601 \text{ m/s} $$

**Answer:** The average velocity is **12.0601 m/s**, which is a close approximation to the true instantaneous velocity of 12 m/s.
</details>

##### **5.7. Relating Graph Slope to Velocity**
**Question:** Consider the graph of `s(t) = t³`. Is the velocity of the particle greater at `t = 1` or `t = 2`? Explain using the concept of the tangent line.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Visualize the Graph**: The graph of `s(t) = t³` gets steeper as `t` increases.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
2.  **Tangent Line Slope**: The derivative, which represents instantaneous velocity, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph.
3.  **Compare Slopes**: A steeper curve means a tangent line with a larger slope. Since the curve is steeper at `t = 2` than at `t = 1`, the slope of the tangent line is greater at `t = 2`.
4.  **Conclusion**: Therefore, the velocity is greater at `t = 2`. We can confirm this with the derivative `s'(t) = 3t²`: `s'(1) = 3` and `s'(2) = 12`.

**Answer:** The velocity is greater at `t = 2` because the slope of the graph's tangent line is steeper at that point.
