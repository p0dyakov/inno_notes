#### **1. Summary**
##### **1.1 Introduction**

A famous quote attributed to the mathematician David Hilbert goes: "You know, for a mathematician, he did not have enough imagination. But he has become a poet and now he is fine." This highlights the creative and imaginative aspect of mathematics, which is essential for understanding concepts like derivatives.

##### **1.2 The Purpose of Derivative Formulas**

###### **1.2.1 From Visual to Computational**

The **derivative** of a function visually represents the *slope of the line tangent* to the function's graph at any given point. This slope tells us the function's instantaneous rate of change at that point. While this visual understanding is crucial, the next step in calculus is to learn how to compute these derivatives using explicit formulas. For a given function, like $f(x) = \sin(x)x^2$, we want to find a corresponding formula for its derivative, denoted as $\frac{df}{dx}(x)$.

###### **1.2.2 Abstract Functions and Real-World Applications**

It is important to understand why we focus on computing derivatives for abstract functions. Much of a calculus student's time is spent on these abstract computations rather than on concrete rate-of-change problems. The reason is that many real-world phenomena are modeled using these pure, abstract functions.

-   **Velocity** of a moving object.
-   **Oscillation** of a spring.
-   **Population growth**.

These applications are often described by polynomials (like $2x^2 - x^3$), trigonometric functions (like $\sin(x)$), and exponential functions (like $e^x$). By developing a strong command of the rules for differentiating these abstract functions, we build a powerful language to describe and analyze how things change in countless concrete situations.

##### **1.3 The Power Rule: A Geometric Approach**

The **Power Rule** is a fundamental formula for finding the derivatives of functions in the form $f(x) = x^n$. We can derive this rule intuitively using geometry.

###### **1.3.1 Case Study: f(x) = x²**

Let's visualize the function $f(x) = x^2$ as the area of a square with side length $x$.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

If we increase the side length $x$ by a tiny amount, $dx$, the area of the square increases by a small amount, which we'll call $df$. This added area, $df$, consists of:

-   Two thin rectangles, each with an area of $x \cdot dx$.
-   One tiny square in the corner, with an area of $(dx)^2$.

So, the total change in area is $df = 2x \cdot dx + (dx)^2$.

When we consider the derivative $\frac{df}{dx}$, we are interested in the ratio of the change in area to the change in side length as $dx$ becomes infinitesimally small. The term $(dx)^2$ becomes negligible much faster than the $2x \cdot dx$ term. Therefore, we can say that the most significant part of the change in area is $2x \cdot dx$.

$$ \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{2x \cdot dx}{dx} = 2x $$

Thus, the derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$.

###### **1.3.2 Case Study: f(x) = x³**

We can extend this idea to $f(x) = x^3$, which represents the volume of a cube with side length $x$.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

If we increase the side length by a tiny amount $dx$, the volume increases by $df$. This added volume is composed mainly of three thin square slabs, one on each of the three faces meeting at a corner.

-   Each slab has a volume of (Area of face) $\times$ (thickness) = $x^2 \cdot dx$.
-   The total volume from these three slabs is $3x^2 \cdot dx$.

There are other, smaller pieces of volume along the edges and at the corner, but these are proportional to $(dx)^2$ and $(dx)^3$ and become negligible as $dx$ approaches zero. So, the dominant part of the change in volume is $df \approx 3x^2 \cdot dx$.

$$ \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{3x^2 \cdot dx}{dx} = 3x^2 $$

The derivative of $x^3$ is $3x^2$.

##### **1.4 The Power Rule: General Formula**

From these geometric examples, a pattern emerges, which is known as the **Power Rule**:
$$ \frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1} $$
This rule states that to find the derivative of $x$ raised to some power $n$, you bring the exponent $n$ down as a multiplier and then reduce the original exponent by one. This holds true for any power $n$, including negative and fractional exponents.

##### **1.5 Derivative of sin(θ): A Geometric View**

To find the derivative of $\sin(\theta)$, we use the **unit circle** (a circle with radius 1).

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

-   The value of $\sin(\theta)$ is the y-coordinate (the height) of a point on the unit circle corresponding to an angle $\theta$.
-   Let's consider a small increase in the angle by an amount $d\theta$. This corresponds to moving a small distance $d\theta$ along the circumference.
-   This small step results in a small change in height, which is $d(\sin(\theta))$.
-   If we zoom in on this section, the small arc $d\theta$ can be approximated as the hypotenuse of a tiny right-angled triangle.
-   The vertical side of this triangle is $d(\sin(\theta))$.
-   This small triangle is similar to the larger triangle formed by the radius, the x-axis, and the vertical line representing $\sin(\theta)$. The angle at the top of the small triangle is also $\theta$.
-   Using trigonometry on this small triangle:
    $$ \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{d(\sin(\theta))}{d\theta} $$
-   From the larger triangle, we know that the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse is $\cos(\theta)$.
-   Therefore, we can conclude:
    $$ \frac{d}{d\theta}\sin(\theta) = \cos(\theta) $$

#### **2. Definitions**
*   **Derivative**: The instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect to one of its variables. Geometrically, it is the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at a specific point.
*   **Power Rule**: A fundamental rule in calculus stating that the derivative of $f(x) = x^n$ is $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$ for any real number $n$.
*   **Unit Circle**: A circle with a radius of one, centered at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. It is used to define trigonometric functions for all real numbers.
*   **Infinitesimal**: A quantity that is closer to zero than any standard real number but is not zero itself. In this context, `dx` and `dθ` represent infinitesimal changes.

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **Derivative Notation**: The derivative of a function $f$ with respect to a variable $x$ is written as $\frac{df}{dx}$.
*   **The Power Rule**:
    $$ \frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1} $$
*   **Derivative of Sine**:
    $$ \frac{d}{d\theta}\sin(\theta) = \cos(\theta) $$
*   **Derivative of Cosine** (by similar geometric reasoning):
    $$ \frac{d}{d\theta}\cos(\theta) = -\sin(\theta) $$

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Incorrectly Applying the Power Rule:** A common mistake is to only subtract one from the exponent without multiplying by the original exponent. For example, stating the derivative of $x^3$ is $x^2$ instead of $3x^2$.
*   **Ignoring Negligible Terms:** In geometric proofs, failing to understand why terms like $(dx)^2$ can be ignored. **Why it's wrong:** The essence of a derivative is a limit as the change ($dx$) approaches zero. Higher powers of $dx$ approach zero much faster, making them irrelevant to the final slope.
*   **Confusing the Function's Value with its Slope:** Looking at the value of $f(x)$ on a graph and thinking it represents the derivative. **Why it's wrong:** The derivative is the slope of the tangent line at that point, not the y-value of the point itself.
*   **Mixing up Radians and Degrees:** The derivative rules for trigonometric functions like $\sin(\theta)$ are only valid when $\theta$ is measured in radians.

##### **5.7 Geometric Interpretation of a Derivative**

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
1. **Relate the change in area ($dA$) to the change in side length ($dx$):** From the geometric derivation, the change in area is approximately the sum of the areas of two thin rectangles.
   $$ dA \approx 2x \cdot dx $$
2. **Substitute the current side length:** Here, $x=10$.
   $$ dA \approx 2(10) \cdot dx = 20 \cdot dx $$
   
**Answer:** The change in area is approximately **20 times** the small change in the side length. This means the rate of change of the area with respect to the side length at this instant is 20.
