#### **1. Summary**
##### **1.1 The Problem of Continuous Averages**
###### **1.1.1 Finite vs. Continuous Averages**
Typically, to find the **average** of a set of numbers, you sum them up and divide by the count of numbers. For example, the average of $\{1, 4, 2, 5\}$ is $(1+4+2+5)/4 = 3$.

However, this method fails for a **continuous variable** described by a function, like $f(x) = \sin(x)$ over the interval $[0, \pi]$. In this interval, there are *infinitely many values* of $\sin(x)$. You cannot simply sum up an infinite number of values and divide by infinity; the concept is not well-defined.

###### **1.1.2 Approximating the Average**
To solve this, we can start by approximating. Instead of using all infinitely many values, we can take a finite, representative sample.

1.  **Sample Points:** Choose a large number of evenly spaced points within the interval $[0, \pi]$.
2.  **Calculate Heights:** Find the value (height) of the function, $\sin(x)$, at each of these sample points.
3.  **Compute Finite Average:** Add up these heights and divide by the number of points sampled.

As we increase the number of sample points, making them closer together, this approximation should get closer to the true average value of the continuous function.

##### **1.2 Connecting Averages to Integrals**
###### **1.2.1 From Finite Sum to Riemann Sum**
The process of approximating an average leads directly to the concept of an integral. Let's analyze the formula for our finite approximation:
$$ \text{Average} \approx \frac{\sum \sin(x_i)}{\text{Number of samples}} $$
The number of samples can be expressed using the length of the interval and the distance between samples, which we'll call $dx$.
$$ \text{Number of samples} \approx \frac{\text{Length of Interval}}{dx} = \frac{\pi - 0}{dx} = \frac{\pi}{dx} $$
Substituting this back into our average approximation:
$$ \text{Average} \approx \frac{\sum \sin(x_i)}{\pi / dx} = \frac{1}{\pi} \sum \sin(x_i)dx $$
This expression, $\sum \sin(x_i)dx$, is a **Riemann sum**. It represents the sum of the areas of many thin rectangles under the curve of $\sin(x)$.

###### **1.2.2 The Limit and the Definite Integral**
To get the exact average value, we let the number of samples approach infinity, which means the width of our rectangles, $dx$, approaches zero. In the language of calculus, we take the limit as $dx \to 0$. This transforms the Riemann sum into a definite integral.

The average height of $\sin(x)$ from $0$ to $\pi$ is:
$$ \text{Average Value} = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(x) \,dx $$
This gives us a general formula for the average value of any function.

##### **1.3 The Average Value Formula**
###### **1.3.1 General Formula**
The average value of a continuous function $f(x)$ on a closed interval $[a, b]$ is given by:
$$ \text{Average Value} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx $$
This formula can be interpreted geometrically. The integral $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx$ represents the *signed area* under the curve of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$. The term $b-a$ is the width of the interval.

Therefore, the formula is conceptually:
$$ \text{Average Height} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Width}} $$
This means the average value is the height of a rectangle that has the same width ($b-a$) and the same area as the region under the curve of $f(x)$.

###### **1.3.2 Example Calculation: $\sin(x)$**
To find the average value of $\sin(x)$ on $[0, \pi]$:
1.  **Find the Antiderivative:** The antiderivative of $\sin(x)$ is $-\cos(x)$.
2.  **Evaluate the Integral:** Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
    $$ \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(x) \,dx = [-\cos(x)]_{0}^{\pi} = (-\cos(\pi)) - (-\cos(0)) = (-(-1)) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2 $$
3.  **Apply the Average Value Formula:**
    $$ \text{Average Value} = \frac{1}{\pi - 0} \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(x) \,dx = \frac{1}{\pi}(2) = \frac{2}{\pi} $$
The average height of the $\sin(x)$ curve between $0$ and $\pi$ is $\frac{2}{\pi} \approx 0.637$.

##### **1.4 An Alternate Perspective: The Fundamental Theorem**
The average value formula provides another way to understand the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**.
$$ \text{Average Value} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx = \frac{F(b) - F(a)}{b-a} $$
Where $F(x)$ is the antiderivative of $f(x)$.

The expression $\frac{F(b) - F(a)}{b-a}$ is the definition of the *average rate of change* (or average slope) of the function $F(x)$ over the interval $[a, b]$.

Since $f(x)$ is the derivative (the instantaneous rate of change) of $F(x)$, this reveals a profound connection:
*   The **average value** of a function $f(x)$ over an interval is equal to the **average slope** of its antiderivative $F(x)$ over that same interval.

#### **2. Definitions**
*   **Continuous Variable**: A variable that can take on any value within a given interval, as opposed to a discrete variable which can only take on specific, separate values.
*   **Average Value of a Function**: A concept that extends the arithmetic mean to continuous functions. It represents the height of a rectangle with the same base and area as the region under the function's curve over that interval.
*   **Antiderivative**: A function $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of a function $f(x)$ if $F'(x) = f(x)$. It is the reverse process of differentiation.
*   **Riemann Sum**: An approximation of the area under a curve, calculated by summing the areas of a finite number of simple shapes, typically rectangles.

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **Average of a Finite Set**: $\text{Average} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n}$
*   **Average Value of a Continuous Function**: $\text{Average} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx$
*   **Geometric Interpretation**: $\text{Average Height} = \frac{\text{Area Under Curve}}{\text{Width of Interval}}$
*   **Antiderivative Form (Mean Value Theorem for Integrals)**: $\text{Average} = \frac{F(b) - F(a)}{b-a}$, where $F'(x) = f(x)$.

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Forgetting to divide by the interval length:** Calculating only $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx$ gives the total signed area under the curve, not the average value. You must divide this area by the width of the interval, $b-a$.
*   **Assuming the average value is simply the midpoint of the function's values at the endpoints:** Calculating $\frac{f(a) + f(b)}{2}$ is incorrect for most functions. This method only works for straight lines.
*   **Using an incorrect interval width:** The denominator must be the total length of the interval, calculated as $b-a$. A common mistake is using just $b$ or forgetting to subtract.
*   **Errors in finding the antiderivative:** The entire calculation depends on correctly identifying the antiderivative of $f(x)$ to evaluate the definite integral.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Set up the formula:** The interval is $[0, 12]$, so $a=0$, $b=12$, and the width is $b-a=12$.
    $$ \text{Average Temp} = \frac{1}{12-0} \int_{0}^{12} \left(20 + 5\sin\left(\frac{\pi t}{12}\right)\right) \,dt $$

    *   The full antiderivative is $20t - \frac{60}{\pi}\cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{12}\right)$.
3.  **Evaluate the definite integral:**
    $$ \int_{0}^{12} T(t) \,dt = \left[ 20t - \frac{60}{\pi}\cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{12}\right) \right]_{0}^{12} $$
    $$ = \left(20(12) - \frac{60}{\pi}\cos(\pi)\right) - \left(20(0) - \frac{60}{\pi}\cos(0)\right) $$
    $$ = \left(240 - \frac{60}{\pi}(-1)\right) - \left(0 - \frac{60}{\pi}(1)\right) = 240 + \frac{60}{\pi} + \frac{60}{\pi} = 240 + \frac{120}{\pi} $$
4.  **Calculate the average value:**
    $$ \text{Average Temp} = \frac{1}{12} \left(240 + \frac{120}{\pi}\right) = 20 + \frac{10}{\pi} \approx 23.18 $$
