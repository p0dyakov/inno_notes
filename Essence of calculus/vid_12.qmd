#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 The Limitations of a Graph-Centric View**

###### **1.1.1 Standard Calculus Visuals**
In a typical introductory calculus course, the core concepts are heavily tied to the visual representation of functions as graphs.

-   The **Derivative** is visualized as the *slope of the tangent line* to the graph at a specific point.
-   The **Integral** is understood as the *area under the graph* over a certain interval.

While these graphical intuitions are powerful for functions mapping real numbers to real numbers (from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$), they become a conceptual hurdle when advancing to higher-level mathematics.

###### **1.1.2 Generalizing Calculus**
In fields like **multivariable calculus**, **complex analysis**, or **differential geometry**, functions often operate in spaces where a simple 2D graph is not possible. For example, a function mapping a complex number to another complex number ($C \rightarrow C$) would require four dimensions to graph. When the core understanding of a derivative is rigidly tied to the idea of "slope," it becomes difficult to generalize the concept to these new contexts.

##### **1.2 The Transformational View of a Derivative**

###### **1.2.1 Functions as Transformations**
An alternative way to visualize a function is as a **transformation** that maps all the points from an input number line to corresponding points on an output number line. This view focuses on how the function *moves*, *stretches*, or *squishes* the space of numbers.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.2.2 The Derivative as a Scaling Factor**
In this transformational context, the derivative of a function at a specific input point, $df/dx(x)$, gives a precise measure of how much the space immediately surrounding that point is being stretched or squished.

-   If $|df/dx| > 1$, the space is **stretched**.
-   If $|df/dx| < 1$, the space is **squished** or **contracted**.
-   If $|df/dx| = 1$, the space is locally unchanged in scale.
-   If $df/dx < 0$, the space is also **flipped** in its orientation.

This perspective is more flexible and generalizes more seamlessly to higher dimensions and different mathematical contexts.

##### **1.3 Fixed Points and Stability**

###### **1.3.1 Defining Fixed Points**
A **fixed point** of a function $f(x)$ is a value $x$ such that $f(x) = x$. When the function is applied to this value, the output is the same as the input; the point does not move.

This concept is crucial for analyzing iterative processes, such as the famous continued fraction for the golden ratio:
$$ x = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \dots}} $$
This is equivalent to finding the fixed point of the function $f(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{x}$.

###### **1.3.2 Stable vs. Unstable Fixed Points**
A function can have multiple fixed points, but not all are "attractive."

-   A **Stable Fixed Point** is a point where, if you start with an input *near* it and repeatedly apply the function, the outputs will get closer and closer, converging on the fixed point.
-   An **Unstable Fixed Point** is a point that *repels* nearby values. If you start near it and repeatedly apply the function, the outputs will move away.

The stability of a fixed point is determined by the derivative at that point.

-   **Stable Fixed Point Condition**: A fixed point $x$ is stable if $|f'(x)| < 1$. The function contracts the space around the point, pulling nearby values inward.
-   **Unstable Fixed Point Condition**: A fixed point $x$ is unstable if $|f'(x)| > 1$. The function expands the space around the point, pushing nearby values away.

For the function $f(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{x}$, the fixed points are the golden ratio, $\varphi \approx 1.618$, and its "little brother," $1-\varphi \approx -0.618$.

-   At $x = \varphi$, the derivative is $f'(\varphi) = -1/\varphi^2 \approx -0.38$. Since $|-0.38| < 1$, this is a **stable** fixed point.
-   At $x = 1-\varphi$, the derivative is $f'(1-\varphi) = -1/(1-\varphi)^2 \approx -2.62$. Since $|-2.62| > 1$, this is an **unstable** fixed point.

This explains why numerically iterating this function, regardless of the starting value (with very few exceptions), will always converge to the golden ratio.

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Derivative (Traditional View)**: The instantaneous rate of change of a function, visually represented as the slope of the tangent line to its graph.
*   **Derivative (Transformational View)**: A measure of the local scaling factor of a function. It describes how much the function stretches or squishes the input space around a specific point.
*   **Fixed Point**: An input value `x` for a function `f` such that `f(x) = x`. It is a point that remains unchanged after the function is applied.
*   **Stable Fixed Point**: A fixed point that attracts nearby values under repeated application of the function. This occurs when the absolute value of the derivative at the fixed point is less than 1.
*   **Unstable Fixed Point**: A fixed point that repels nearby values under repeated application of the function. This occurs when the absolute value of the derivative at the fixed point is greater than 1.

#### **3. Formulas**

*   **Fixed Point Equation**: $f(x) = x$
*   **Condition for a Stable Fixed Point**: $|f'(x)| < 1$
*   **Condition for an Unstable Fixed Point**: $|f'(x)| > 1$
*   **Derivative of $x^n$ (Power Rule)**: $\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$

#### **4. Mistakes**

*   **Relying Solely on Graphical Intuition:** Limiting the concept of a derivative to just the "slope of a graph" makes it difficult to apply in contexts beyond single-variable calculus, such as complex analysis or vector fields.
*   **Assuming All Fixed Points Are Stable:** Finding a value where $f(x) = x$ does not guarantee that an iterative process will converge to it. The stability depends entirely on the derivative at that point.
*   **Ignoring the Magnitude of the Derivative for Stability:** The sign of the derivative indicates orientation (flipping), but it's the *absolute value* (magnitude) that determines whether a fixed point is stable (`< 1`) or unstable (`> 1`).
*   **Assuming a Continued Fraction Represents All Fixed Points:** A continued fraction, defined as a limit of an iterative process, will only converge to a *stable* fixed point. Unstable fixed points are valid algebraic solutions but are not reachable through this iterative method.

#### **5. Examples**

##### **5.1 Derivative as a Scaling Factor**
**Question:** Consider the function $f(x) = x^3$. What is the derivative at $x=2$, and what does it mean from a transformational perspective?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find the derivative:** Using the power rule, $f'(x) = 3x^2$.
2.  **Evaluate at $x=2$:** $f'(2) = 3(2)^2 = 12$.
3.  **Interpretation:** At the input $x=2$, the function $f(x) = x^3$ stretches the number line by a factor of 12. A very small interval around 2 will be mapped to an interval around $f(2)=8$ that is 12 times larger.

**Answer:** The derivative is **12**, which represents a local stretching factor of 12.

##### **5.2 Finding Fixed Points**
**Question:** Find the fixed points of the function $g(x) = x^2 - 2$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Set up the fixed-point equation:** We need to solve $g(x) = x$.
    $$ x^2 - 2 = x $$
2.  **Rearrange into a quadratic equation:**
    $$ x^2 - x - 2 = 0 $$
3.  **Factor the quadratic:**
    $$ (x-2)(x+1) = 0 $$
4.  **Solve for x:** The solutions are $x = 2$ and $x = -1$.

**Answer:** The fixed points are **2** and **-1**.
</details>

##### **5.3 Determining Fixed Point Stability**
**Question:** For the function $g(x) = x^2 - 2$, determine whether the fixed points at $x=2$ and $x=-1$ are stable or unstable.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find the derivative:** $g'(x) = 2x$.
2.  **Check stability at $x=2$:**
    *   Evaluate the derivative: $g'(2) = 2(2) = 4$.
    *   Check the condition: $|g'(2)| = |4| = 4$. Since $4 > 1$, the fixed point is unstable.
3.  **Check stability at $x=-1$:**
    *   Evaluate the derivative: $g'(-1) = 2(-1) = -2$.
    *   Check the condition: $|g'(-1)| = |-2| = 2$. Since $2 > 1$, this fixed point is also unstable.

**Answer:** Both fixed points, **2** and **-1**, are **unstable**.
</details>

##### **5.4 Finding Another Fixed Point**
**Question:** Find the fixed point(s) of the function $h(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x + \frac{9}{x})$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Set up the equation $h(x) = x$:**
    $$ \frac{1}{2}\left(x + \frac{9}{x}\right) = x $$
2.  **Solve for x:**
    $$ x + \frac{9}{x} = 2x $$
    $$ \frac{9}{x} = x $$
    $$ 9 = x^2 $$
    $$ x = \pm 3 $$

**Answer:** The fixed points are **3** and **-3**.
</details>

##### **5.5 Stability of a Square Root Function**
**Question:** For the function $h(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x + \frac{9}{x})$, determine the stability of the fixed points $x=3$ and $x=-3$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find the derivative:**
    $$ h'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{9}{2}x^{-1}\right) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{9}{2}x^{-2} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{9}{2x^2} $$
2.  **Check stability at $x=3$:**
    *   $h'(3) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{9}{2(3)^2} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{9}{18} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 0$.
    *   $|h'(3)| = 0$. Since $0 < 1$, the fixed point is stable.
3.  **Check stability at $x=-3$:**
    *   $h'(-3) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{9}{2(-3)^2} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{9}{18} = 0$.
    *   $|h'(-3)| = 0$. Since $0 < 1$, this fixed point is also stable.

**Answer:** Both fixed points, **3** and **-3**, are **stable**. This iterative method is actually a way to find square roots, known as the Babylonian method.
</details>

##### **5.6 Unstable Divergence**
**Question:** Explain why repeatedly applying the function $f(x) = 3x$ starting from any non-zero value will diverge from its fixed point at $x=0$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Identify the fixed point:** Solving $3x = x$ gives $2x = 0$, so $x=0$ is the only fixed point.
2.  **Find the derivative:** $f'(x) = 3$.
3.  **Check the stability:** The derivative is constant. $|f'(0)| = 3$. Since $3 > 1$, the fixed point is unstable.
4.  **Interpretation:** At every point, the function stretches the number line by a factor of 3. This pushes any starting value further away from the origin with each iteration, causing it to diverge.

**Answer:** The fixed point at $x=0$ is **unstable** because the magnitude of the derivative, $|3|$, is greater than 1.
</details>

##### **5.7 Stability of a Trigonometric Function**
**Question:** The function $f(x) = \cos(x)$ has a unique fixed point at $x \approx 0.739$. Determine if this point is stable.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find the derivative of the function:**
    $$ f'(x) = -\sin(x) $$
2.  **Evaluate the derivative at the fixed point $x \approx 0.739$ (in radians):**
    $$ f'(0.739) = -\sin(0.739) \approx -0.674 $$
3.  **Check the stability condition:**
    $$ |f'(0.739)| = |-0.674| \approx 0.674 $$
    Since $0.674 < 1$, the fixed point is stable.

**Answer:** The fixed point is **stable**. If you repeatedly press the cosine button on a calculator (in radian mode), the result will converge to this value.
