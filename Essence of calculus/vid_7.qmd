#### **1. Summary**
##### **1.1 The Concept of a Limit**
###### **1.1.1 Intuitive Understanding**
The concept of a **limit** in calculus formalizes the idea of a value being "approached." If you understand what it means for one value to get closer and closer to another, you already have the fundamental intuition behind limits. For example, when finding a derivative, we consider what happens to the ratio $\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}$ as the change in input, $\Delta x$, gets arbitrarily close to zero. The limit is the value that this ratio approaches.

###### **1.1.2 Formal Notation**
The formal notation for a limit is written as $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$, which is read as "the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$." This means that as the input $x$ gets closer and closer to the value $a$, the output of the function $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to the value $L$.

##### **1.2 The Formal Definition of a Derivative**
###### **1.2.1 Connecting Intuition to Formalism**
The intuitive idea of a derivative involves a tiny nudge to an input, $dx$, causing a corresponding tiny change in the output, $df$. The derivative is then the ratio $\frac{df}{dx}$. However, to make this rigorous, we use limits.

The **formal definition of the derivative** of a function $f(x)$ at a point, say $x=2$, is expressed using a limit. Instead of an infinitesimally small $dx$, we use a variable, commonly denoted as $h$, which represents a concrete, non-zero nudge.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

The change in the function's output is $f(2+h) - f(2)$. The ratio of the change in output to the change in input is:
$$ \frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h} $$
The derivative is what this ratio approaches *as h gets arbitrarily close to zero*. This is written formally as:
$$ f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h} $$
This limit-based definition avoids the logical paradoxes of working with "infinitely small" quantities while preserving the core concept. The notation $\frac{df}{dx}$ is essentially shorthand for this entire limit expression.

##### **1.3 The Epsilon-Delta (ε, δ) Definition of Limits**
###### **1.3.1 Rigorous Definition of "Approach"**
To make the idea of "approaching" mathematically airtight, mathematicians developed the **epsilon-delta (ε, δ) definition**. It precisely defines what it means for a limit to exist.

A limit $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ exists if, for any small positive distance **epsilon** ($\epsilon$) you choose, you can find a corresponding small positive distance **delta** ($\delta$) such that if an input $x$ is within $\delta$ of $a$ (but not equal to $a$), then the output $f(x)$ is guaranteed to be within $\epsilon$ of $L$.

Essentially, you challenge the limit by picking an arbitrarily small "tolerance" ($\epsilon$) around the proposed limit $L$. If the limit holds, you must be able to find an input range ($\delta$) around $a$ that ensures all outputs fall within that tolerance.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.3.2 Discontinuous Functions**
This definition is powerful because it also clarifies when a limit does *not* exist. For a function with a jump discontinuity at $x=a$, you can pick an $\epsilon$ that is smaller than the size of the jump. No matter how small you make the input range $\delta$ around $a$, the corresponding output values will always span a range larger than your chosen $\epsilon$, so you can't guarantee they will all be close to a single value $L$. The limit, therefore, does not exist.

##### **1.4 L'Hôpital's Rule**
###### **1.4.1 Solving Indeterminate Forms**
**L'Hôpital's Rule** is a practical method for finding the limit of a ratio of two functions, $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, when both functions approach zero at the limiting point (an **indeterminate form** of the type $\frac{0}{0}$).

If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$, then:
$$ \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} $$
...provided the limit on the right side exists.

###### **1.4.2 Intuition Behind the Rule**
The intuition comes from the fact that near the point $a$, where both functions are zero, the functions can be approximated by their tangent lines. The value of $f(x)$ near $a$ is approximately $f'(a) \cdot (x-a)$, and the value of $g(x)$ is approximately $g'(a) \cdot (x-a)$.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
The ratio $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ is therefore approximately:
$$ \frac{f'(a)(x-a)}{g'(a)(x-a)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)} $$
This shows that the limit of the ratio of the functions is the same as the ratio of their derivatives (slopes) at that point.

#### **2. Definitions**
*   **Limit**: The value that a function or sequence "approaches" as the input or index approaches some value.
*   **Derivative (Formal Definition)**: The limit of the ratio of the change in a function's output to the change in its input, as the change in the input approaches zero. It represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function.
*   **Indeterminate Form**: An expression in mathematics, such as $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, which does not have a readily determined value. Limits involving these forms require further analysis.
*   **(ε, δ) Definition of a Limit**: A rigorous formulation of a limit, stating that for any given distance $\epsilon$ from the limit value $L$, there exists a distance $\delta$ from the input value $a$ such that all inputs within $\delta$ of $a$ have outputs within $\epsilon$ of $L$.
*   **L'Hôpital's Rule**: A rule that uses derivatives to help evaluate limits of indeterminate forms. It states that the limit of a quotient of two functions is equal to the limit of the quotient of their derivatives.

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **Formal Definition of the Derivative**: 
    $$ f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} $$
*   **L'Hôpital's Rule**: If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$, then
    $$ \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} $$

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Applying L'Hôpital's Rule Incorrectly:** Using the quotient rule on the fraction $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ instead of taking the derivatives of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ separately. **Why it's wrong:** The rule specifically requires the ratio of the individual derivatives, not the derivative of the ratio.
*   **Using L'Hôpital's Rule on a Determinate Form:** Applying the rule when the limit is not of the form $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. **Why it's wrong:** L'Hôpital's Rule is only valid for indeterminate forms and will give an incorrect answer for other cases.
*   **Assuming a Limit Doesn't Exist for `0/0`:** Concluding that a limit is undefined simply because plugging in the value yields $\frac{0}{0}$. **Why it's wrong:** The form $\frac{0}{0}$ is indeterminate, meaning the limit could be any value, and it requires further analysis like factoring or L'Hôpital's Rule.
*   **Confusing the Limit with the Function's Value:** Believing that the limit of a function at a point must equal the function's value at that point. **Why it's wrong:** The limit describes the behavior of the function *near* the point, which can exist even if the function is undefined at that specific point (e.g., a hole in the graph).

#### **5. Examples**
##### **5.1. Finding a Derivative Using the Formal Definition**
**Question:** Find the derivative of $f(x) = x^3$ at $x=2$ using the limit definition.

1.  **Set up the limit expression:**
    $$ f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h} $$
2.  **Substitute the function $f(x) = x^3$:**
    $$ f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(2+h)^3 - 2^3}{h} $$
3.  **Expand the numerator:** $(2+h)^3 = 2^3 + 3(2^2)h + 3(2)h^2 + h^3 = 8 + 12h + 6h^2 + h^3$.
    $$ f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(8 + 12h + 6h^2 + h^3) - 8}{h} $$
4.  **Simplify the expression:**
    $$ f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{12h + 6h^2 + h^3}{h} $$
5.  **Factor out $h$ from the numerator and cancel:**
    $$ f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h(12 + 6h + h^2)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} (12 + 6h + h^2) $$
6.  **Evaluate the limit by substituting $h=0$:**
    $$ f'(2) = 12 + 6(0) + (0)^2 = 12 $$

**Answer:** The derivative of $x^3$ at $x=2$ is **12**.

##### **5.2. Simple Limit Evaluation**
**Question:** Evaluate the limit $\lim_{x \to 3} (2x^2 - 4x + 1)$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Check for continuity:** The function is a polynomial, which is continuous everywhere.
2.  **Direct substitution:** Since the function is continuous at $x=3$, we can find the limit by directly substituting the value.
    $$ 2(3)^2 - 4(3) + 1 $$
3.  **Calculate the result:**
    $$ 2(9) - 12 + 1 = 18 - 12 + 1 = 7 $$

**Answer:** The limit is **7**.
</details>

##### **5.3. Limit with Indeterminate Form (Factoring)**
**Question:** Evaluate the limit $\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Attempt direct substitution:** Plugging in $x=1$ gives $\frac{1^2 - 1}{1 - 1} = \frac{0}{0}$, which is an indeterminate form.
2.  **Factor the numerator:** The numerator is a difference of squares, $x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)$.
    $$ \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1} $$
3.  **Cancel the common factor:** Since $x$ approaches 1 but is not equal to 1, $x-1$ is not zero, and we can cancel it.
    $$ \lim_{x \to 1} (x+1) $$
4.  **Evaluate the simplified limit:**
    $$ 1 + 1 = 2 $$

**Answer:** The limit is **2**.
</details>

##### **5.4. L'Hôpital's Rule: Basic Example**
**Question:** Evaluate the limit $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ using L'Hôpital's Rule.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Check for indeterminate form:** As $x \to 0$, $\sin(x) \to 0$ and $x \to 0$. This is the $\frac{0}{0}$ form.
2.  **Apply L'Hôpital's Rule:** Take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator separately.
    *   Derivative of $\sin(x)$ is $\cos(x)$.
    *   Derivative of $x$ is $1$.
    $$ \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x)}{1} $$
3.  **Evaluate the new limit:**
    $$ \frac{\cos(0)}{1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 $$

**Answer:** The limit is **1**.
</details>

##### **5.5. L'Hôpital's Rule: More Complex Example**
**Question:** Evaluate the limit $\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{x^2 - 1}$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Check for indeterminate form:** As $x \to 1$, $\sin(\pi x) \to \sin(\pi) = 0$ and $x^2 - 1 \to 1^2 - 1 = 0$. This is the $\frac{0}{0}$ form.
2.  **Apply L'Hôpital's Rule:** Take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator.
    *   Derivative of $\sin(\pi x)$ is $\pi \cos(\pi x)$ (using the chain rule).
    *   Derivative of $x^2 - 1$ is $2x$.
    $$ \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{x^2 - 1} = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{\pi \cos(\pi x)}{2x} $$
3.  **Evaluate the new limit by direct substitution:**
    $$ \frac{\pi \cos(\pi \cdot 1)}{2(1)} = \frac{\pi \cos(\pi)}{2} = \frac{\pi(-1)}{2} = -\frac{\pi}{2} $$

**Answer:** The limit is **$-\frac{\pi}{2}$**.
</details>

##### **5.6. Epsilon-Delta Concept**
**Question:** For the limit $\lim_{x \to 2} (3x-1) = 5$, if we want the output to be within $\epsilon = 0.03$ of 5, what is the largest $\delta$ we can choose for the input range around 2?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Set up the epsilon inequality:** We want the distance between the function and its limit to be less than $\epsilon$.
    $$ |(3x - 1) - 5| < 0.03 $$
2.  **Simplify the inequality:**
    $$ |3x - 6| < 0.03 $$
    $$ 3|x - 2| < 0.03 $$
3.  **Isolate the delta term, $|x - 2|$:**
    $$ |x - 2| < \frac{0.03}{3} $$
    $$ |x - 2| < 0.01 $$
4.  **Identify delta:** The inequality is in the form $|x - a| < \delta$. Here, $a=2$ and $\delta=0.01$.

**Answer:** The largest delta ($\delta$) we can choose is **0.01**.
</details>

##### **5.7. When Not to Use L'Hôpital's Rule**
**Question:** Evaluate the limit $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x)}{x+1}$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Attempt direct substitution:** Let's see if this is an indeterminate form.
    $$ \frac{\cos(0)}{0+1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 $$
2.  **Conclusion:** The limit is not an indeterminate form. We can evaluate it directly. L'Hôpital's Rule is not necessary and would be incorrect to apply. (If we did apply it, we would get $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{-\sin(x)}{1} = 0$, which is the wrong answer).

**Answer:** The limit is **1**.
