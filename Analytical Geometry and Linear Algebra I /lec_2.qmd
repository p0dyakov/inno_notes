#### 1. Summary
##### 1.1 The Inner Product

An **inner product** is a function that takes two vectors and produces a single scalar number. Think of it as a generalized way to multiply two vectors. For an operation to be considered a valid inner product on a vector space, it must satisfy four key properties, often called axioms:

1.  **Symmetry**: The order of the vectors doesn't matter.
    $$ \langle u, v \rangle = \langle v, u \rangle $$
2.  **Linearity**: Scaling one of the vectors by a constant `c` scales the entire inner product by `c`.
    $$ \langle cu, v \rangle = c \langle u, v \rangle $$
3.  **Additivity**: The inner product distributes over vector addition.
    $$ \langle u + w, v \rangle = \langle u, v \rangle + \langle w, v \rangle $$
4.  **Positive Definiteness**: The inner product of a vector with itself is always non-negative. It is zero *if and only if* the vector itself is the zero vector.
    $$ \langle v, v \rangle \ge 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \langle v, v \rangle = 0 \iff v = 0 $$

A vector space equipped with a specific inner product is called an **inner product space**.

##### 1.2 The Dot Product: The Standard Inner Product on $\mathbb{R}^n$

The most common example of an inner product is the **dot product** (also known as the Euclidean inner product). For two vectors $u = (u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n)$ and $v = (v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, the dot product is defined as the sum of the products of their corresponding components:

$$ u \cdot v = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \dots + u_nv_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i v_i $$

The dot product satisfies all four axioms of an inner product and is the foundation for Euclidean geometry in two and three dimensions.

##### 1.3 Vector Norm (Length)

The inner product provides a natural way to define the **length** or **norm** of a vector. The norm of a vector $v$, denoted $\|v\|$, is the square root of the inner product of the vector with itself:

$$ \|v\| = \sqrt{\langle v, v \rangle} $$

For the standard dot product in $\mathbb{R}^n$, this becomes the familiar distance formula: $\|v\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \dots + v_n^2}$.

##### 1.4 Geometric Interpretation: Angles and the Dot Product

The dot product elegantly connects algebra with geometry. For two non-zero vectors $v$ and $w$, their dot product is related to the angle $\theta$ between them by the formula:

$$ v \cdot w = \|v\| \|w\| \cos \theta $$

This relationship is fundamental. It allows us to calculate the angle between two vectors:

$$ \theta = \arccos\left(\frac{v \cdot w}{\|v\| \|w\|}\right) $$

The sign of the dot product tells us about the angle:
*   **Positive ($v \cdot w > 0$)**: The angle $\theta$ is acute ($< 90^\circ$).
*   **Zero ($v \cdot w = 0$)**: The angle $\theta$ is a right angle ($= 90^\circ$). The vectors are **orthogonal**.
*   **Negative ($v \cdot w < 0$)**: The angle $\theta$ is obtuse ($> 90^\circ$).

##### 1.5 Orthogonality

Two vectors are **orthogonal** (perpendicular) if their inner product is zero. This is a direct consequence of the geometric formula, since $\cos(90^\circ) = 0$. This provides a simple algebraic test for perpendicularity.

$$ v \text{ is orthogonal to } w \iff v \cdot w = 0 $$

##### 1.6 Vector Projection

Projection allows us to find the component of one vector that lies in the direction of another.

*   The **vector projection** of $v$ onto $w$, denoted $\text{proj}_w(v)$, is the "shadow" that vector $v$ casts on vector $w$. It is a vector that is parallel to $w$.
*   The **scalar projection** of $v$ onto $w$, denoted $\text{comp}_w(v)$, is the *signed length* of this shadow. It is a scalar.

The formulas are:
$$ \text{proj}_w(v) = \left(\frac{v \cdot w}{w \cdot w}\right) w \quad \text{and} \quad \text{comp}_w(v) = \frac{v \cdot w}{\|w\|} $$

##### 1.7 Decomposing a Vector

Any vector $v$ can be broken down (decomposed) into two orthogonal components relative to another vector $w$:
1.  A component **parallel** to $w$: $v_{\parallel} = \text{proj}_w(v)$.
2.  A component **orthogonal** to $w$: $v_{\perp} = v - v_{\parallel}$.

This gives us $v = v_{\parallel} + v_{\perp}$, where $v_{\parallel} \cdot v_{\perp} = 0$.

##### 1.8 Key Inequalities

Two important inequalities arise from the properties of the inner product:

*   **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**: This states that the absolute value of the inner product of two vectors is always less than or equal to the product of their norms.
    $$ |\langle v, w \rangle| \le \|v\| \|w\| $$
*   **Triangle Inequality**: This states that the length of the sum of two vectors is less than or equal to the sum of their individual lengths. Geometrically, this means the length of one side of a triangle is never greater than the sum of the other two sides.
    $$ \|v + w\| \le \|v\| + \|w\| $$

#### 2. Definitions

*   **Inner Product**: A function that takes two vectors from a vector space and returns a scalar, satisfying the axioms of symmetry, linearity, additivity, and positive definiteness.
*   **Dot Product**: The standard inner product on $\mathbb{R}^n$, calculated by summing the products of corresponding vector components.
*   **Inner Product Space**: A vector space that has a defined inner product.
*   **Norm (Vector Length)**: The length of a vector, defined as $\|v\| = \sqrt{\langle v, v \rangle}$.
*   **Orthogonal Vectors**: Two vectors whose inner product is zero.
*   **Vector Projection**: The vector component of one vector that lies along the direction of a second vector.
*   **Scalar Projection**: The signed length of the vector projection.

#### 3. Formulas

*   **Dot Product (Algebraic)**: $u \cdot v = \sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i v_i$
*   **Norm from Dot Product**: $\|v\| = \sqrt{v \cdot v}$
*   **Dot Product (Geometric)**: $v \cdot w = \|v\| \|w\| \cos \theta$
*   **Angle Between Vectors**: $\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{v \cdot w}{\|v\| \|w\|}\right)$
*   **Vector Projection of $v$ onto $w$**: $\text{proj}_w(v) = \left(\frac{v \cdot w}{w \cdot w}\right) w$
*   **Scalar Projection of $v$ onto $w$**: $\text{comp}_w(v) = \frac{v \cdot w}{\|w\|}$
*   **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**: $|v \cdot w| \le \|v\| \|w\|$
*   **Triangle Inequality**: $\|u + v\| \le \|u\| + \|v\|$

#### 4. Mistakes

*   **Assuming $a \cdot b = a \cdot c$ implies $b=c$**: This is incorrect. The dot product does not have a general cancellation property. For example, if $a = (1, 1)$, $b = (2, 2)$, and $c = (4, 0)$, then $a \cdot b = 4$ and $a \cdot c = 4$, but clearly $b \neq c$. **Why it's wrong:** Geometrically, this condition means that $b$ and $c$ have the same projection onto $a$, but their orthogonal components can be different.
*   **Confusing Scalar and Vector Projection**: The scalar projection is a number (a signed length), while the vector projection is a vector. You cannot use one in place of the other. **Why it's wrong:** They represent different concepts; one is a magnitude, and the other is a physical vector with both magnitude and direction.
*   **Incorrectly Defining Vectors for Angles in a Triangle**: When finding an angle like $\angle ABC$, the vectors used must both originate from the vertex $B$. You must use vectors $\vec{BA}$ and $\vec{BC}$, not $\vec{AB}$ and $\vec{BC}$. **Why it's wrong:** Using vectors that don't share a common origin will result in calculating the exterior angle or a completely unrelated angle.
*   **Forgetting the Square Root for the Norm**: The norm $\|v\|$ is $\sqrt{v \cdot v}$. A common mistake is to forget the square root and use $\|v\|^2$ instead of $\|v\|$. **Why it's wrong:** This is a simple calculation error that affects all subsequent geometric calculations, such as finding angles or scalar projections.
*   **Normalizing the Wrong Vector in Projection**: The projection formula $\left(\frac{v \cdot w}{w \cdot w}\right) w$ scales the vector $w$. A mistake is to divide by $v \cdot v$ or multiply by $v$. **Why it's wrong:** You are projecting *onto* $w$, so the resulting vector must be a multiple of $w$. The scalar factor is determined by the dot products involving both vectors, but the direction is determined solely by $w$.

1.  **Define vectors from the vertex B:** The angle $\angle ABC$ is formed by vectors $\vec{BA}$ and $\vec{BC}$.
    $$ \vec{BA} = A - B = (1-3, 2-(-1)) = (-2, 3) $$
    $$ \vec{BC} = C - B = (-2-3, 1-(-1)) = (-5, 2) $$

##### Example 6: Decomposing a Vector
**Question:** Decompose the vector $a = (5, 1, -3)$ into two vectors, one parallel to $b = (1, 2, 2)$ ($a_\parallel$) and one orthogonal to it ($a_\perp$).

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find the parallel component ($a_\parallel$) using vector projection:**
    $$ a_\parallel = \text{proj}_b(a) = \left(\frac{a \cdot b}{b \cdot b}\right) b $$
2.  **Calculate the dot products:**
    $$ a \cdot b = (5)(1) + (1)(2) + (-3)(2) = 5 + 2 - 6 = 1 $$
    $$ b \cdot b = (1)^2 + (2)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 $$
3.  **Calculate the parallel vector:**
    $$ a_\parallel = \left(\frac{1}{9}\right) (1, 2, 2) = \left(\frac{1}{9}, \frac{2}{9}, \frac{2}{9}\right) $$
4.  **Find the orthogonal component ($a_\perp$) by subtraction:**
    $$ a_\perp = a - a_\parallel = (5, 1, -3) - \left(\frac{1}{9}, \frac{2}{9}, \frac{2}{9}\right) $$
    $$ a_\perp = \left(5-\frac{1}{9}, 1-\frac{2}{9}, -3-\frac{2}{9}\right) = \left(\frac{44}{9}, \frac{7}{9}, -\frac{29}{9}\right) $$
5.  **(Optional) Verify orthogonality:**
    $$ a_\parallel \cdot a_\perp = \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)\left(\frac{44}{9}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)\left(\frac{7}{9}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)\left(-\frac{29}{9}\right) = \frac{44 + 14 - 58}{81} = \frac{0}{81} = 0 $$
    The dot product is 0, so the components are orthogonal.

**Answer:** The parallel component is **$a_\parallel = (\frac{1}{9}, \frac{2}{9}, \frac{2}{9})$** and the orthogonal component is **$a_\perp = (\frac{44}{9}, \frac{7}{9}, -\frac{29}{9})$**.
