#### 1. Summary

##### 1.1 Introduction to Matrices

A **matrix** is a rectangular grid of numbers arranged in rows and columns. The size, or **dimension**, of a matrix is given by *m x n*, where *m* is the number of rows and *n* is the number of columns.

*   **Square Matrix**: A matrix with an equal number of rows and columns (*n x n*).
*   **Identity Matrix ($I$)**: A square matrix with ones on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and zeros everywhere else. It is the matrix equivalent of the number 1.
*   **Zero Matrix**: A matrix where all entries are zero.
*   **Diagonal Matrix**: A square matrix where all non-diagonal elements are zero.
*   **Symmetric Matrix**: A square matrix that is equal to its transpose ($A = A^T$).
*   **Triangular Matrix**: A square matrix where all entries above or below the main diagonal are zero. It can be *upper triangular* or *lower triangular*.

##### 1.2 Basic Matrix Operations

*   **Addition and Subtraction**: These are performed **element-wise** on matrices of the *same dimensions*. You simply add or subtract the corresponding entries.
*   **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying a matrix by a scalar (a single number) involves multiplying *every element* in the matrix by that scalar.
*   **Transpose ($A^T$)**: The transpose of a matrix is formed by swapping its rows and columns. The first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on. If $A$ is an *m x n* matrix, $A^T$ will be an *n x m* matrix.
*   **Trace (tr(A))**: The trace of a **square matrix** is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal.

##### 1.3 Matrix Multiplication

Multiplying two matrices, $A$ and $B$, is more complex. To get the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of the product matrix $AB$, you take the dot product of the $i$-th row of $A$ with the $j$-th column of $B$.

*   *Compatibility*: For the product $AB$ to be defined, the number of columns in matrix $A$ must equal the number of rows in matrix $B$.
*   *Non-Commutativity*: A critical property of matrix multiplication is that it is **not commutative**. In general, **$AB \neq BA$**. The order of multiplication matters.

##### 1.4 The Determinant

The **determinant** is a special scalar value that can only be calculated from a **square matrix**. It provides important information about the matrix.

*   **Significance**: A non-zero determinant means the matrix is **invertible**. Geometrically, the determinant represents the scaling factor of the linear transformation described by the matrix.
*   **Calculation (2x2)**: For $A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$, the determinant is $\det(A) = ad - bc$.
*   **Calculation (3x3)**: This can be done using Sarrus's rule or, more generally, through cofactor expansion.

##### 1.5 The Matrix Inverse ($A^{-1}$)

The **inverse** of a square matrix $A$ is another matrix, denoted $A^{-1}$, such that their product is the identity matrix ($AA^{-1} = I$).

*   **Existence**: An inverse exists only if the matrix is **non-singular**, meaning its determinant is non-zero ($\det(A) \neq 0$).
*   **Adjugate Method**: A common way to find the inverse is:
    1.  **Matrix of Minors ($M_{ij}$)**: For each element, find the determinant of the sub-matrix that remains after deleting its row and column.
    2.  **Matrix of Cofactors ($C_{ij}$)**: Apply a "checkerboard" pattern of signs to the matrix of minors using the formula $C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij}$.
    3.  **Adjugate Matrix (adj(A))**: Transpose the matrix of cofactors.
    4.  **Inverse**: The inverse is found by multiplying the adjugate matrix by the reciprocal of the determinant: $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \text{adj}(A)$.

##### 1.6 Vector Cross Product

The **cross product** is an operation between two vectors in 3D space ($\mathbb{R}^3$) that results in a new **vector**.

*   **Perpendicularity**: The resulting vector, $\vec{a} \times \vec{b}$, is perpendicular to both $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$.
*   **Magnitude**: The magnitude of the cross product, $||\vec{a} \times \vec{b}||$, is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors. The area of the triangle formed by them is half of this value.
*   **Direction**: The direction of the resulting vector is determined by the **right-hand rule**.
*   **Anti-Commutativity**: The cross product is anti-commutative: $\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = -(\vec{b} \times \vec{a})$.

##### 1.7 Scalar Triple Product

The **scalar triple product** involves three vectors from $\mathbb{R}^3$ and results in a **scalar** value. It is calculated as $\vec{a} \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{c})$.

*   **Geometric Interpretation**: The absolute value of the scalar triple product represents the **volume** of the parallelepiped formed by the three vectors.
*   **Coplanarity**: If the scalar triple product is zero, it means the volume is zero, and therefore the three vectors lie on the same plane (they are **coplanar**).

#### 2. Definitions

*   **Matrix**: A rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns.
*   **Square Matrix**: A matrix with the same number of rows as columns.
*   **Identity Matrix ($I$)**: A square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere, which acts as the multiplicative identity.
*   **Transpose ($A^T$)**: A matrix obtained by swapping the rows and columns of another matrix.
*   **Determinant ($\det(A)$)**: A scalar value associated with a square matrix that determines if the matrix is invertible.
*   **Singular Matrix**: A square matrix whose determinant is zero, meaning it has no inverse.
*   **Adjugate Matrix (adj(A))**: The transpose of the cofactor matrix.
*   **Cross Product ($\vec{a} \times \vec{b}$)**: A binary operation on two vectors in 3D space that produces a vector perpendicular to both original vectors.
*   **Scalar Triple Product ($\vec{a} \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{c})$)**: A product of three vectors that yields a scalar representing the volume of the parallelepiped they span.
*   **Coplanar Vectors**: A set of vectors that all lie in the same plane.

#### 3. Formulas

*   **2x2 Determinant**: $\det \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = ad - bc$
*   **Matrix Inverse (Adjugate Method)**: $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \text{adj}(A)$
*   **Cofactor**: $C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij}$, where $M_{ij}$ is the minor.
*   **Cross Product (Determinant Form)**: $\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = \det \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \end{pmatrix}$
*   **Area of Triangle (with vertices A, B, C)**: $\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} ||\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}||$
*   **Scalar Triple Product / Volume**: $V = |\vec{a} \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{c})| = \left| \det \begin{pmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \\ c_1 & c_2 & c_3 \end{pmatrix} \right|$

#### 4. Mistakes

*   **Assuming Matrix Multiplication is Commutative**: Multiplying matrices in a different order usually produces a different result ($AB \neq BA$). **Why it's wrong**: The row-by-column multiplication process is order-dependent.
*   **Forgetting the Sign Pattern for Cofactors**: When calculating the matrix of cofactors, it's easy to forget the $(-1)^{i+j}$ term, which creates a "checkerboard" pattern of positive and negative signs. **Why it's wrong**: The signs are essential for the definition of the determinant and the inverse.
*   **Mistaking the Determinant of a Scaled Matrix**: For an $n \times n$ matrix, $\det(kA) = k^n \det(A)$, not $k \det(A)$. **Why it's wrong**: The scalar $k$ applies to each of the $n$ rows, and the determinant is multiplicative across rows.
*   **Applying Cross Product to 2D Vectors**: The cross product is exclusively defined for vectors in three-dimensional space. **Why it's wrong**: The concept of a single vector being mutually perpendicular to two other vectors requires a third dimension.
*   **Confusing Adjugate and Inverse**: The adjugate matrix is the transpose of the cofactor matrix. You must still divide it by the determinant to get the final inverse. **Why it's wrong**: The adjugate is an intermediate step; without dividing by the determinant, $A \cdot \text{adj}(A) = \det(A)I$, not $I$.

#### 5. Examples

##### Example 1: Matrix Operation Sizing (Lab 3, 1a)

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Analyze the multiplication `PR`**:
    *   P has dimensions (4 x 5).
    *   R has dimensions (5 x 2).
    *   The inner dimensions match (5 and 5), so the product is defined.
    *   The resulting matrix `PR` will have the outer dimensions: (4 x 2).
2.  **Analyze the addition `(PR) + S`**:
    *   The matrix `PR` has dimensions (4 x 2).
    *   The matrix `S` has dimensions (4 x 2).
    *   Since both matrices have the same dimensions, the addition is defined.
3.  **Determine the final size**: The resulting matrix will have the same dimensions as the operands, which is (4 x 2).

**Answer:** The expression is defined, and the resulting matrix has a size of **4 x 2**.

##### Example 2: Matrix Multiplication (Lab 3, 2b)
**Question:** Given $A = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ -1 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & -1 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$, compute the product `AB`.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Check dimensions**: A is (3 x 2) and B is (2 x 2). The inner dimensions match, so the product is defined. The result will be a (3 x 2) matrix.
2.  **Calculate the element at Row 1, Column 1**:
    (Row 1 of A) $\cdot$ (Column 1 of B) = $(3)(4) + (0)(0) = 12$.
3.  **Calculate the element at Row 1, Column 2**:
    (Row 1 of A) $\cdot$ (Column 2 of B) = $(3)(-1) + (0)(2) = -3$.
4.  **Calculate the element at Row 2, Column 1**:
    (Row 2 of A) $\cdot$ (Column 1 of B) = $(-1)(4) + (2)(0) = -4$.
5.  **Calculate the element at Row 2, Column 2**:
    (Row 2 of A) $\cdot$ (Column 2 of B) = $(-1)(-1) + (2)(2) = 1 + 4 = 5$.
6.  **Calculate the element at Row 3, Column 1**:
    (Row 3 of A) $\cdot$ (Column 1 of B) = $(1)(4) + (1)(0) = 4$.
7.  **Calculate the element at Row 3, Column 2**:
    (Row 3 of A) $\cdot$ (Column 2 of B) = $(1)(-1) + (1)(2) = -1 + 2 = 1$.
8.  **Assemble the final matrix**:
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} 12 & -3 \\ -4 & 5 \\ 4 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $$

**Answer:** The resulting matrix is **$\begin{pmatrix} 12 & -3 \\ -4 & 5 \\ 4 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$**.

##### Example 3: Determinant with Scalar Multiplication (Lab 3, 2e)
**Question:** Given $D = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 & 2 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\ 3 & 2 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$, compute $\det(2D)$.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Recall the property of determinants with scalar multiplication**: For an $n \times n$ matrix, $\det(kA) = k^n \det(A)$.
2.  **Identify n and k**: Here, D is a 3x3 matrix, so $n=3$. The scalar is $k=2$. Therefore, $\det(2D) = 2^3 \det(D) = 8 \det(D)$.
3.  **Calculate $\det(D)$ using Sarrus's Rule**:
    *   Sum of main diagonals: $(1)(0)(4) + (5)(1)(3) + (2)(-1)(2) = 0 + 15 - 4 = 11$.
    *   Sum of anti-diagonals: $(2)(0)(3) + (1)(1)(2) + (5)(-1)(4) = 0 + 2 - 20 = -18$.
    *   $\det(D) = (11) - (-18) = 11 + 18 = 29$.
4.  **Calculate the final result**: $\det(2D) = 8 \times \det(D) = 8 \times 29 = 232$.

**Answer:** $\det(2D) = 232$.

##### Example 4: Area of a Triangle (Tutorial, Problem 1)
**Question:** Compute the area of a triangle with vertices at A(1, 2, 0), B(3, 0, -3), and C(5, 2, 6).

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Define two vectors spanning the triangle from vertex A**:
    *   $\vec{AB} = B - A = (3-1, 0-2, -3-0) = \langle 2, -2, -3 \rangle$.
    *   $\vec{AC} = C - A = (5-1, 2-2, 6-0) = \langle 4, 0, 6 \rangle$.
2.  **Compute the cross product $\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}$**:
    $$ \vec{AB} \times \vec{AC} = \det \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -2 & -3 \\ 4 & 0 & 6 \end{pmatrix} $$
    *   $\mathbf{i}$ component: $((-2)(6) - (-3)(0)) = -12$.
    *   $\mathbf{j}$ component: $-((2)(6) - (-3)(4)) = -(12 + 12) = -24$.
    *   $\mathbf{k}$ component: $((2)(0) - (-2)(4)) = 8$.
    *   The resulting vector is $\langle -12, -24, 8 \rangle$.
3.  **Find the magnitude of the cross product vector**:
    $$ ||\langle -12, -24, 8 \rangle|| = \sqrt{(-12)^2 + (-24)^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{144 + 576 + 64} = \sqrt{784} = 28 $$
    This magnitude is the area of the parallelogram formed by $\vec{AB}$ and $\vec{AC}$.
4.  **Calculate the area of the triangle**: The area of the triangle is half the area of the parallelogram.
    $$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 $$

**Answer:** The area of the triangle is **14 square units**.

##### Example 5: Finding a Matrix Inverse (Lab 3, 4a)
**Question:** Find the inverse of the matrix $X = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 4 & -1 \\ 2 & 0 & 7 \\ 1 & -3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}$.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Step 1: Calculate the Determinant of X**.
    $$ \det(X) = 3(0 - (-21)) - 4(-4 - 7) + (-1)(-6 - 0) $$
    $$ \det(X) = 3(21) - 4(-11) - 1(-6) = 63 + 44 + 6 = 113 $$
    Since $\det(X) \neq 0$, the inverse exists.

2.  **Step 2: Find the Matrix of Minors**.
    $$ M = \begin{pmatrix}
    (0)(-2) - (7)(-3) & (2)(-2) - (7)(1) & (2)(-3) - (0)(1) \\
    (4)(-2) - (-1)(-3) & (3)(-2) - (-1)(1) & (3)(-3) - (4)(1) \\
    (4)(7) - (-1)(0) & (3)(7) - (-1)(2) & (3)(0) - (4)(2)
    \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
    21 & -11 & -6 \\
    -11 & -5 & -13 \\
    28 & 23 & -8
    \end{pmatrix} $$

3.  **Step 3: Find the Matrix of Cofactors** (apply the checkerboard sign pattern).
    $$ C = \begin{pmatrix}
    +21 & -(-11) & +(-6) \\
    -(-11) & +(-5) & -(-13) \\
    +28 & -(23) & +(-8)
    \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
    21 & 11 & -6 \\
    11 & -5 & 13 \\
    28 & -23 & -8
    \end{pmatrix} $$

4.  **Step 4: Find the Adjugate Matrix** (transpose the cofactor matrix).
    $$ \text{adj}(X) = C^T = \begin{pmatrix}
    21 & 11 & 28 \\
    11 & -5 & -23 \\
    -6 & 13 & -8
    \end{pmatrix} $$

5.  **Step 5: Calculate the Inverse** using $X^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(X)}\text{adj}(X)$.
    $$ X^{-1} = \frac{1}{113} \begin{pmatrix}
    21 & 11 & 28 \\
    11 & -5 & -23 \\
    -6 & 13 & -8
    \end{pmatrix} $$

**Answer:** $X^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
    21/113 & 11/113 & 28/113 \\
    11/113 & -5/113 & -23/113 \\
    -6/113 & 13/113 & -8/113
    \end{pmatrix}$
