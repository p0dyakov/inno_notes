#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Introduction to Matrices**
A **matrix** is a rectangular grid or array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. It's a fundamental tool for organizing and manipulating data. A matrix is typically denoted by a capital letter, such as A.

The **dimensions** of a matrix describe its size and are given as *m x n*, where *m* is the number of rows and *n* is the number of columns. The individual items in a matrix are called its **elements** or **entries**. The element in the *i*-th row and *j*-th column is denoted as $a_{ij}$.

For example, a 2x3 matrix A would look like this:
$$ A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \end{pmatrix} $$

##### **1.2 Types of Matrices**
Certain types of matrices have special properties and names:
*   **Square Matrix**: A matrix where the number of rows equals the number of columns (*m = n*).
*   **Identity Matrix ($I$)**: A square matrix with ones on the main diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right) and zeros everywhere else. It is the matrix equivalent of the number 1, as multiplying any matrix by the identity matrix leaves it unchanged ($AI = A$).
*   **Zero Matrix**: A matrix where all elements are zero.
*   **Diagonal Matrix**: A square matrix where all elements outside the main diagonal are zero. The elements on the diagonal can be any number.
*   **Symmetric Matrix**: A square matrix that is equal to its transpose ($A = A^T$). This means the element $a_{ij}$ is equal to the element $a_{ji}$ for all *i* and *j*.
*   **Triangular Matrix**: A square matrix where all elements above or below the main diagonal are zero. If the elements below are zero, it's an **upper triangular matrix**. If the elements above are zero, it's a **lower triangular matrix**.

##### **1.3 Basic Matrix Operations**
*   **Addition and Subtraction**: These operations can only be performed on matrices of the *same dimensions*. The operation is done element-wise, meaning you add or subtract the corresponding elements in each matrix. If $C = A + B$, then $c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}$.
*   **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying a matrix by a **scalar** (a single number) involves multiplying *every element* of the matrix by that scalar. If $B = \lambda A$, then $b_{ij} = \lambda a_{ij}$.
*   **Transpose**: The **transpose** of a matrix, denoted $A^T$, is formed by swapping its rows and columns. The first row of A becomes the first column of $A^T$, the second row becomes the second column, and so on. If A is an *m x n* matrix, $A^T$ will be an *n x m* matrix.
*   **Trace**: The **trace** of a square matrix, denoted `tr(A)`, is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal.

##### **1.4 Matrix Multiplication**
Multiplying two matrices, A and B, is more complex. For the product AB to be defined, the number of columns in matrix A must be equal to the number of rows in matrix B. If A is *m x n* and B is *n x p*, the resulting matrix C will have dimensions *m x p*.

The element $c_{ij}$ of the resulting matrix is calculated by taking the dot product of the *i*-th row of A and the *j*-th column of B.

A critical property of matrix multiplication is that it is *not commutative*, which means that in general, **$AB \neq BA$**. The order of multiplication matters. However, it is **associative** ($(AB)C = A(BC)$) and **distributive** ($A(B + C) = AB + AC$).

##### **1.5 The Determinant of a Matrix**
The **determinant** is a special scalar value that can only be calculated from a square matrix. It is denoted as `det(A)` or $|A|$. The determinant provides important information about the matrix:
*   *Invertibility*: If `det(A)` is not zero, the matrix has an inverse. If `det(A)` is zero, the matrix is **singular** and does not have an inverse.
*   *Geometric Interpretation*: The determinant represents the scaling factor of a linear transformation. For instance, the absolute value of the determinant of a 2x2 matrix tells you how the area of a shape changes when transformed by the matrix.

For a 2x2 matrix $ A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} $, the determinant is `det(A) = ad - bc`.

For a 3x3 matrix, the calculation is more involved and can be done using **Sarrus's Rule** or **Laplace (Cofactor) Expansion**.

##### **1.6 The Matrix Inverse**
The **inverse** of a square matrix A, denoted $A^{-1}$, is a matrix that, when multiplied by A, results in the identity matrix ($AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I$). Only non-singular (determinant is not zero) square matrices have an inverse.

To find the inverse of a 3x3 matrix, one common method is the **adjugate method**:
1.  **Matrix of Minors**: For each element, find its **minor**, which is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix that remains after deleting the element's row and column.
2.  **Matrix of Cofactors**: Create the **cofactor** matrix by applying a "checkerboard" pattern of signs (+, -, +, -, etc.) to the matrix of minors. The cofactor $C_{ij}$ is $(-1)^{i+j}M_{ij}$, where $M_{ij}$ is the minor.
3.  **Adjugate Matrix**: Find the **adjugate** matrix, `adj(A)`, by taking the transpose of the cofactor matrix.
4.  **Calculate Inverse**: The inverse is then found using the formula: $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}\text{adj}(A)$.

##### **1.7 The Vector Cross Product**
The **cross product** is an operation between two vectors in 3D space, denoted **a x b**. The result is a new vector that is *perpendicular* to both of the original vectors.

The direction of the resulting vector is determined by the **right-hand rule**: if you curl the fingers of your right hand from vector **a** to vector **b**, your thumb points in the direction of **a x b**.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
Because of this directional property, the cross product is *anti-commutative*: **a x b = - (b x a)**.

The magnitude of the cross product, $|| \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} ||$, is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors. This is calculated as $|| \mathbf{a} || \, || \mathbf{b} || \sin(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between them. The area of the triangle formed by these vectors is half of this value.

##### **1.8 Triple Products**
*   **Scalar Triple Product**: This product, written as $\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})$, combines the dot product and cross product. The result is a *scalar*. Geometrically, its absolute value represents the **volume of the parallelepiped** formed by the three vectors. If the scalar triple product is zero, it means the three vectors are **coplanar** (they lie on the same plane).
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
*   **Vector Triple Product**: This product, written as $\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})$, involves two cross products and results in a *vector*. It can be simplified using the **"BAC-CAB"** identity:
    $$ \mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c})\mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})\mathbf{c} $$

Another important identity involving the vector triple product is the **Jacobi identity**:
    $$ \mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{c} \times (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{0} $$

#### **3. Formulas**

*   **2x2 Matrix Inverse**: $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc} \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix}$.
*   **General Matrix Inverse**: $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \text{adj}(A)$.
*   **Cross Product (Coordinate Form)**: For $\mathbf{a} = \langle a_1, a_2, a_3 \rangle$ and $\mathbf{b} = \langle b_1, b_2, b_3 \rangle$,
    $$ \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \det \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \end{pmatrix} $$

*   **Vector Triple Product Identity**: $\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c})\mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}$.
*   **Area of Parallelogram**: Area $= || \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} ||$.

*   **Volume of Parallelepiped**: Volume $= |\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})|$.

#### **4. Mistakes**

*   **Assuming Matrix Multiplication is Commutative:** Always remember that $AB$ is generally not equal to $BA$. **Why it's wrong:** The process of matrix multiplication (dot product of rows with columns) is dependent on order. Swapping the matrices changes which rows are multiplied by which columns, leading to a different result.
*   **Forgetting the Sign Pattern in Cofactor Expansion:** When calculating a determinant or a matrix of cofactors, it is easy to forget the $(-1)^{i+j}$ checkerboard pattern of signs. **Why it's wrong:** These signs are a crucial part of the definition of the determinant and cofactors. Omitting them will lead to an incorrect value for the determinant and inverse.
*   **Multiplying Matrices with Incompatible Dimensions:** Trying to multiply an *m x n* matrix by a *p x q* matrix where *n ≠ p*. **Why it's wrong:** The definition of matrix multiplication requires the inner dimensions to match because the dot product is taken between rows of the first matrix (length *n*) and columns of the second (length *p*). If they don't match, the operation is undefined.
*   **Confusing the Adjugate with the Cofactor Matrix:** Using the cofactor matrix directly to find the inverse instead of its transpose (the adjugate). **Why it's wrong:** The formula for the inverse specifically requires the adjugate, which is the transpose of the cofactors. Using the cofactor matrix directly will result in an incorrect inverse.
*   **Incorrectly Applying the Vector Triple Product Rule:** Misremembering the BAC-CAB rule, for example as $(a \cdot b)c - (a \cdot c)b$. **Why it's wrong:** The rule is precise. The positive term is the dot product of the "outer" vectors ($\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{c}$) multiplied by the "middle" vector ($\mathbf{b}$). Getting the order or signs wrong changes the resulting vector completely.

<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Calculate the left side: $\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})$**
