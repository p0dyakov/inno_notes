#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Introduction**
This document provides a quick and intuitive method for computing the eigenvalues of 2x2 matrices. It is intended for those who are already familiar with the fundamental concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors but are looking for a more efficient computational technique than the traditional method involving the characteristic polynomial. The goal is to rediscover this method through its underlying principles.

##### **1.2 Core Concepts Review**

###### **1.2.1 Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**
A linear transformation can be thought of as a stretching, squishing, or rotating of space. While most vectors are knocked off their original span by a transformation, some special vectors are not.

An **eigenvector** of a linear transformation is a non-zero vector whose direction remains unchanged after the transformation is applied; it is only scaled (stretched or shrunk). The **eigenvalue**, denoted by the Greek letter **lambda** ($\lambda$), is the scalar factor by which the eigenvector is scaled.

This relationship is captured by the fundamental eigenvalue equation:
$$ A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v} $$
Where:
- $A$ is the matrix representing the linear transformation.
- $\vec{v}$ is the eigenvector.
- $\lambda$ is the corresponding eigenvalue.

###### **1.2.2 The Characteristic Equation**
To find the eigenvalues, we rearrange the fundamental equation.
$$ A\vec{v} - \lambda\vec{v} = \vec{0} $$
To factor out the vector $\vec{v}$, we must first express the scalar multiplication $\lambda\vec{v}$ as a matrix-vector product. We do this by introducing the **identity matrix** $I$.
$$ A\vec{v} - (\lambda I)\vec{v} = \vec{0} $$
$$ (A - \lambda I)\vec{v} = \vec{0} $$
Since an eigenvector $\vec{v}$ must be non-zero by definition, this equation tells us that the matrix $(A - \lambda I)$ transforms a non-zero vector into the zero vector. This is only possible if the transformation represented by $(A - \lambda I)$ squishes space into a lower dimension (e.g., a 2D plane into a 1D line). A transformation that reduces dimensionality has a determinant of zero.

Therefore, to find the eigenvalues ($\lambda$), we must solve the **characteristic equation**:
$$ \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 $$

##### **1.3 The Traditional Method**
The standard approach involves solving the characteristic equation directly. For a general 2x2 matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$, this looks like:
$$ \det\left(\begin{pmatrix} a-\lambda & b \\ c & d-\lambda \end{pmatrix}\right) = 0 $$
Expanding this determinant gives the **characteristic polynomial**:
$$ (a-\lambda)(d-\lambda) - bc = 0 $$
$$ \lambda^2 - (a+d)\lambda + (ad-bc) = 0 $$
The roots of this quadratic polynomial are the eigenvalues of the matrix. While effective, this process requires several algebraic steps which can be cumbersome.

##### **1.4 A Quicker Method: The Three Key Facts**
A more direct method for 2x2 matrices relies on three interconnected facts about the relationship between a matrix, its eigenvalues, its trace, and its determinant.

###### **1.4.1 Fact 1: The Trace**
The **trace** of a square matrix is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal. For a 2x2 matrix, `tr(A) = a + d`. A crucial property is that the trace of a matrix is also equal to the sum of its eigenvalues.
$$ \text{tr}(A) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 $$
This implies that the *mean* of the diagonal entries is equal to the *mean* of the eigenvalues.
$$ m = \frac{a+d}{2} = \frac{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}{2} $$

###### **1.4.2 Fact 2: The Determinant**
The **determinant** of a 2x2 matrix is calculated as `det(A) = ad - bc`. The determinant is also equal to the product of the eigenvalues.
$$ p = \det(A) = \lambda_1 \lambda_2 $$
Geometrically, this makes sense because the eigenvalues represent the scaling factors along the principal axes of the transformation, and the determinant represents the overall scaling factor for area.

###### **1.4.3 Fact 3: Recovering Eigenvalues from Mean and Product**
With the mean ($m$) and product ($p$) of the two eigenvalues known, we can find the eigenvalues themselves. The two eigenvalues, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, are symmetrically spaced around their mean, $m$. We can represent them as $m-d$ and $m+d$ for some distance $d$.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

Using the product property:
$$ (m+d)(m-d) = p $$
$$ m^2 - d^2 = p $$
Solving for the distance $d$:
$$ d^2 = m^2 - p \implies d = \sqrt{m^2 - p} $$
Therefore, the two eigenvalues are given by the formula:
$$ \lambda_{1,2} = m \pm \sqrt{m^2 - p} $$

This formula provides a direct path from the matrix entries to the eigenvalues, bypassing the explicit calculation of the characteristic polynomial.

#### **2. Definitions**
*   **Eigenvector**: A non-zero vector whose direction is unchanged by a linear transformation; it is only scaled by a scalar factor.
*   **Eigenvalue**: The scalar factor, denoted $\lambda$, by which an eigenvector is scaled under a linear transformation.
*   **Characteristic Polynomial**: A polynomial derived from a matrix whose roots are the matrix's eigenvalues. It is found by solving the equation $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$.
*   **Trace**: The sum of the elements on the main diagonal of a square matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, this is $a+d$.
*   **Determinant**: A scalar value representing how a linear transformation scales area or volume. For a 2x2 matrix, this is $ad-bc$.
*   **Pauli Spin Matrices**: A set of three 2x2 complex matrices used in quantum mechanics to represent the spin of a particle along the x, y, and z axes.

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **Eigenvalue Equation**: $A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}$
*   **Characteristic Equation**: $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$
*   **Trace-Eigenvalue Relation (2x2)**: $\text{tr}(A) = a+d = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$
*   **Determinant-Eigenvalue Relation (2x2)**: $\det(A) = ad-bc = \lambda_1 \lambda_2$
*   **Quick Eigenvalue Formula (2x2)**: $\lambda_{1,2} = m \pm \sqrt{m^2 - p}$
    *   Where $m = \frac{a+d}{2}$ (the mean of the diagonal) and $p = ad-bc$ (the determinant).

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Applying the 2x2 trick to larger matrices:** This specific formula for $m$ and $p$ is only valid for 2x2 matrices.
*   **Incorrectly calculating the mean (m):** Forgetting to divide the trace $(a+d)$ by 2.
*   **Confusing the product (p) with the trace (tr):** The product of eigenvalues is the determinant ($ad-bc$), not the trace ($a+d$).
*   **Arithmetic errors in the final formula:** Simple mistakes when squaring the mean or subtracting the product under the square root are common.
*   **Forgetting the non-zero vector condition:** An eigenvector must, by definition, be a non-zero vector. This is the justification for requiring the determinant of $(A - \lambda I)$ to be zero.
*   **Ignoring complex numbers:** If $m^2 - p$ is negative, the eigenvalues will be complex numbers. This is a valid outcome.
