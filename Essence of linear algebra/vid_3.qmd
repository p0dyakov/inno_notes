#### **1. Summary**
##### **1.1 Transformations**
###### **1.1.1 Transformation as a Function**
The term **transformation** is essentially a synonym for **function**. It describes a process that takes an input and produces a corresponding output. In the context of linear algebra, we are specifically interested in transformations that take a vector as an input and produce another vector as an output. For example, a transformation `L` could take an input vector $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ and output the vector $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}$.

###### **1.1.2 Visualizing Transformations**
While "function" is a general term, "transformation" suggests a visual interpretation involving movement. A great way to understand functions that operate on vectors is to visualize them as a transformation of space.

-   **Arrow to Arrow:** You can imagine the input vector (an arrow) moving to become the output vector (another arrow).
-   **Point to Point:** A cleaner way is to represent each vector by the single point where its tip is located. The transformation then becomes the movement of every point in space to some other point.
-   **Transforming Space:** To visualize the effect on the entire space, we can observe how an infinite grid of points moves. This gives a sense of the "squishing and morphing" of space itself.

##### **1.2 Linear Transformations**
Linear algebra focuses on a specific, simpler class of transformations called **linear transformations**. These are much easier to understand than arbitrary, complex transformations that might curve and distort space in complicated ways.

###### **1.2.1 Visual Properties of Linearity**
Visually, a transformation is **linear** if it satisfies two conditions:
1.  **All lines remain lines.** The transformation cannot curve any straight lines.
2.  **The origin remains fixed.** The point $(0, 0)$ does not move.

An important consequence of these properties is that *grid lines must remain parallel and evenly spaced*.

###### **1.2.2 Non-Linear Transformations**
-   A transformation that curves straight lines is not linear.
-   A transformation that moves the origin, even if it keeps lines straight, is not linear.

##### **1.3 Describing Linear Transformations with Numbers**
A remarkable property of linear transformations is that they are fully described by where the **basis vectors** ($\hat{\imath}$ and $\hat{\jmath}$) land. Everything else follows from this.

###### **1.3.1 The Role of Basis Vectors**
Any vector $\vec{v}$ with coordinates $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors: $\vec{v} = x\hat{\imath} + y\hat{\jmath}$.

Because a linear transformation keeps grid lines parallel and evenly spaced, the transformed vector, let's call it $L(\vec{v})$, will be the *same linear combination* of the *transformed basis vectors*, $L(\hat{\imath})$ and $L(\hat{\jmath})$.
$$ L(\vec{v}) = L(x\hat{\imath} + y\hat{\jmath}) = x L(\hat{\imath}) + y L(\hat{\jmath}) $$
This means if we know where $\hat{\imath}$ and $\hat{\jmath}$ land, we can deduce where *any* vector lands without needing to watch the transformation itself.

##### **1.4 Matrices as Linear Transformations**
We can package the coordinates of the transformed basis vectors into a 2x2 grid of numbers called a **2x2 matrix**. This matrix completely describes the linear transformation.

-   The **first column** of the matrix represents the coordinates where the first basis vector, $\hat{\imath}$, lands.
-   The **second column** of the matrix represents the coordinates where the second basis vector, $\hat{\jmath}$, lands.

So, for a matrix $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$:
-   $\hat{\imath}$ lands on $\begin{pmatrix} a \\ c \end{pmatrix}$.
-   $\hat{\jmath}$ lands on $\begin{pmatrix} b \\ d \end{pmatrix}$.

###### **1.4.1 Matrix-Vector Multiplication**
The process of applying the transformation described by a matrix to a given vector is called **matrix-vector multiplication**. It is simply the calculation derived in the previous section: taking a linear combination of the matrix's columns using the vector's components as scalars.

$$ \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = x \begin{pmatrix} a \\ c \end{pmatrix} + y \begin{pmatrix} b \\ d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} ax+by \\ cx+dy \end{pmatrix} $$

This formula is the computational result, but the intuition lies in understanding it as the sum of the scaled, transformed basis vectors.

###### **1.4.2 Linearly Dependent Columns**
If the columns of the matrix are **linearly dependent** (meaning one is a multiple of the other), it signifies that the transformation squishes all of 2D space onto the single line defined by the span of those columns.

#### **2. Definitions**
*   **Transformation**: A rule (function) that takes an input, such as a vector, and produces an output. It's often visualized as a movement or "morphing" of space.
*   **Linear Transformation**: A special type of transformation that preserves the structure of vector space. Visually, it's a transformation where lines remain lines, the origin stays fixed, and grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced.
*   **Matrix**: A rectangular array of numbers. In this context, a 2x2 matrix is used to encode a 2D linear transformation, where its columns represent the coordinates where the basis vectors $\hat{\imath}$ and $\hat{\jmath}$ land.
*   **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**: The computational process of applying a linear transformation (represented by a matrix) to a vector. Geometrically, it calculates the landing spot of the vector after the transformation.
*   **Shear**: A type of linear transformation in which one basis vector is held fixed, while the other is pushed parallel to the first. This causes rectangles to be skewed into parallelograms.

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **General Linear Transformation of a Vector**: A transformation $L$ applied to a vector $\vec{v} = x\hat{\imath} + y\hat{\jmath}$ can be calculated using the transformed basis vectors $L(\hat{\imath})$ and $L(\hat{\jmath})$:
    $$ L(\vec{v}) = x L(\hat{\imath}) + y L(\hat{\jmath}) $$
*   **Matrix-Vector Multiplication (2x2)**: The formula for applying the transformation represented by a matrix to a vector:
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} ax + by \\ cx + dy \end{pmatrix} $$
*   **Formal Definition of Linearity**: A transformation $L$ is linear if it satisfies two properties for all vectors $\vec{v}, \vec{w}$ and any scalar $c$:
    -   **Additivity**: $L(\vec{v} + \vec{w}) = L(\vec{v}) + L(\vec{w})$
    -   **Scaling**: $L(c\vec{v}) = cL(\vec{v})$

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Memorizing matrix multiplication mechanically:** Only learning the formula `(ax + by, cx + dy)` without understanding that it represents a linear combination of the transformed basis vectors. **Why it's wrong:** This rote memorization obscures the geometric intuition, making it difficult to understand why matrix multiplication works the way it does and how to apply it conceptually.
*   **Confusing the columns of a matrix with its rows:** Forgetting that the columns represent where the basis vectors $\hat{\imath}$ and $\hat{\jmath}$ land. **Why it's wrong:** The columns define the transformation. Swapping them or using rows instead would describe a completely different and incorrect geometric transformation.
*   **Assuming all geometric transformations are linear:** Trying to represent a transformation that curves lines or moves the origin with a single matrix. **Why it's wrong:** The rules of matrix-vector multiplication are derived from the properties of linearity (parallel, evenly spaced grid lines). These rules do not apply to non-linear transformations.
*   **Viewing a matrix as just a static table of numbers:** Failing to connect a matrix to its dynamic role as a transformation of space. **Why it's wrong:** The real power of matrices in linear algebra comes from interpreting them as functions that stretch, rotate, shear, or squish vector space in a structured way.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **Set up the matrix-vector multiplication:**
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} $$
2.  **Apply the formula** $x L(\hat{\imath}) + y L(\hat{\jmath})$:
    $$ 2 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + 3 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} $$
3.  **Calculate the sum:**
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} $$

##### **5.4 Scaling Transformation**
**Question:** What is the matrix that scales every vector in the plane by a factor of 3?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **Find the new location of $\hat{\imath}$:** The vector $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ scaled by 3 becomes $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$. This is the first column.
2.  **Find the new location of $\hat{\jmath}$:** The vector $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ scaled by 3 becomes $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$. This is the second column.
3.  **Construct the matrix.**

**Answer:** The scaling matrix is **$\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$**.
</details>

##### **5.5 Identifying a Non-Linear Transformation**
**Question:** Is the transformation $L\left(\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\right) = \begin{pmatrix} x^2 \\ y \end{pmatrix}$ a linear transformation? Why or why not?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **Check the properties of linearity:** A key property is that lines must remain lines.
2.  **Consider a vertical line:** Let's take the line $x=1$. Points on this line are $(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), \dots$.
3.  **Apply the transformation:** The transformation sends these points to $(1^2, 0), (1^2, 1), (1^2, 2)$, which simplifies to $(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)$. This line remains a line.
4.  **Consider a horizontal line:** Let's take the line $y=1$. Points on this line are $(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), \dots$.
5.  **Apply the transformation:** The transformation sends these points to $(0^2, 1), (1^2, 1), (2^2, 1)$, which simplifies to $(0, 1), (1, 1), (4, 1)$. The points no longer form a straight line (the spacing between x-coordinates is not uniform).
    
**Answer:** It is **not a linear transformation** because it does not keep all lines straight.
</details>

##### **5.6 Projection onto the x-axis**
**Question:** What is the matrix for the linear transformation that projects every vector onto the x-axis?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **Project $\hat{\imath}$:** The vector $\hat{\imath} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is already on the x-axis, so it remains unchanged. This is the first column.
2.  **Project $\hat{\jmath}$:** The vector $\hat{\jmath} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected down to the origin, $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$. This is the second column.
3.  **Construct the matrix.**

**Answer:** The projection matrix is **$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$**. Note that the columns are linearly dependent, which makes sense as the transformation squishes 2D space onto a 1D line.
</details>

##### **5.7 Reflection across the y-axis**
**Question:** Find the matrix that reflects every vector across the y-axis.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **Determine where $\hat{\imath}$ lands:** Reflecting $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ across the y-axis moves it to $\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$. This is the first column.
2.  **Determine where $\hat{\jmath}$ lands:** The vector $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ lies on the y-axis, so it does not move. The second column is $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
3.  **Construct the matrix.**

**Answer:** The reflection matrix is **$\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$**.
