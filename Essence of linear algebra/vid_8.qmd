#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Introduction to Non-Square Matrices**
Linear transformations are not limited to vectors within the same dimension. It's entirely possible to have transformations that map vectors from one dimensional space to a different one. These transformations are represented by **non-square matrices**.

A matrix with **`m` rows and `n` columns** (an `m x n` matrix) describes a linear transformation from an `n`-dimensional space to an `m`-dimensional space.

-   The number of **columns (`n`)** tells you the dimension of the **input space**. This is because each column specifies where one of the basis vectors of the input space lands after the transformation.
-   The number of **rows (`m`)** tells you the dimension of the **output space**. This is because the number of entries in each column vector determines the number of coordinates needed to describe the output vectors.

For a transformation to be considered *linear*, it must maintain two properties: all grid lines must remain parallel and evenly spaced, and the origin of the input space must map to the origin of the output space.

##### **1.2 Transformation from 2D to 3D (`3x2` Matrix)**
A `3x2` matrix represents a linear transformation from a 2-dimensional space to a 3-dimensional space.

-   **Two columns**: This indicates the input space is 2D and has two basis vectors, $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$.
-   **Three rows**: This indicates that the output vectors exist in a 3D space, as each basis vector's new position is described by three coordinates.

Essentially, this transformation takes the entire 2D input plane and maps it onto a flat plane that is embedded within a 3D space. The two columns of the matrix are the 3D coordinates specifying where the original 2D basis vectors, $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$, land in this new 3D output space.

The **column space** of this matrix, which is the span of its column vectors, is the resulting 2D plane in 3D space. If the dimension of this column space (2D) is equal to the dimension of the input space (2D), the matrix is said to be of **full rank**.

##### **1.3 Transformation from 3D to 2D (`2x3` Matrix)**
A `2x3` matrix represents a linear transformation that maps a 3-dimensional space onto a 2-dimensional plane.

-   **Three columns**: This indicates the input space is 3D, with three basis vectors: $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$.
-   **Two rows**: This indicates that the output vectors are 2D, as the landing spot for each basis vector is described by only two coordinates.

This transformation involves a "squishing" of dimensions, projecting the 3D space down into a 2D plane. Information is lost in this process, as a full dimension is collapsed.

##### **1.4 Transformation from 2D to 1D (`1x2` Matrix)**
A `1x2` matrix describes a transformation from a 2D plane to a 1D space, which is simply the number line.

-   **Two columns**: The input is a 2D vector.
-   **One row**: The output is a 1D vector, which is a single number (a scalar).

This type of transformation takes a vector and outputs a number. The two columns of the `1x2` matrix are single numbers that tell you where the basis vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ land on the number line. This concept is fundamentally linked to the **dot product**, which takes two vectors and produces a single scalar value.

#### **2. Definitions**

-   **Non-Square Matrix**: A matrix where the number of rows (`m`) is not equal to the number of columns (`n`).
-   **m x n Matrix**: A matrix with `m` rows and `n` columns. It represents a linear transformation from an `n`-dimensional input space to an `m`-dimensional output space.
-   **Input Space**: The vector space of the initial vectors before transformation. The dimension of this space is equal to the number of columns in the transformation matrix.
-   **Output Space**: The vector space where the results of the transformation land. The dimension of this space is equal to the number of rows in the transformation matrix.
-   **Column Space**: The set of all possible output vectors of a linear transformation. It is the span of the column vectors of the matrix. The dimension of the column space is the rank of the matrix.
-   **Full Rank**: A matrix is full rank when its rank is the maximum possible for its dimensions. For an `m x n` matrix, the rank is `min(m, n)`. When a transformation maps to a higher dimension (e.g., 2D to 3D), it's considered full rank if the dimension of the column space equals the dimension of the input space.

#### **3. Formulas**

-   **General Linear Transformation**: A vector $\vec{v}$ is transformed by matrix $A$ into vector $A\vec{v}$.
    $$ L(\vec{v}) = A\vec{v} $$
-   **Transformation from 2D to 3D (`3x2` Matrix)**:
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \\ e & f \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = x \begin{pmatrix} a \\ c \\ e \end{pmatrix} + y \begin{pmatrix} b \\ d \\ f \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} ax+by \\ cx+dy \\ ex+fy \end{pmatrix} $$
-   **Transformation from 3D to 2D (`2x3` Matrix)**:
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = x \begin{pmatrix} a \\ d \end{pmatrix} + y \begin{pmatrix} b \\ e \end{pmatrix} + z \begin{pmatrix} c \\ f \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} ax+by+cz \\ dx+ey+fz \end{pmatrix} $$

#### **4. Mistakes**

-   **Confusing input and output dimensions:** The number of columns determines the input dimension, and the number of rows determines the output dimension, not the other way around. A `3x2` matrix takes a 2D vector and produces a 3D vector.
-   **Calculating a determinant for a non-square matrix:** The determinant is a concept that relates to the scaling of area (in 2D) or volume (in 3D) and is only defined for square matrices. Asking for the determinant of a `2x3` matrix is a trick question.
-   **Assuming the transformation can be inverted:** A transformation from a higher dimension to a lower one (e.g., 3D to 2D) loses information and cannot be uniquely reversed. Similarly, a transformation from a lower to a higher dimension (e.g., 2D to 3D) is not onto (it doesn't fill the entire output space), so it also lacks a true inverse.
-   **Thinking input and output vectors live in the same space:** For non-square matrices, the input and output spaces are fundamentally different and unconnected. A 2D input vector is a different kind of object from a 3D output vector.
