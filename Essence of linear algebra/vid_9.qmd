#### **1. Summary**
##### **1.1 Introduction to the Dot Product**
The **dot product** is a fundamental operation in linear algebra that takes two vectors and returns a single scalar (a number). Traditionally, it is one of the first topics taught in a linear algebra course. However, its true significance and the connection between its numerical and geometric interpretations are best understood through the lens of linear transformations. This is why some approaches, like the one in this series, introduce it after concepts like matrices and transformations have been established.

##### **1.2 The Standard View**
There are two primary ways to understand the dot product: numerically and geometrically.

###### **1.2.1 Numerical Calculation**
The most straightforward way to compute the dot product of two vectors is to multiply their corresponding components and then add the results. For two vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ of the same dimension, this is calculated as:
$$ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = v_1 w_1 + v_2 w_2 + \dots + v_n w_n $$
For example, the dot product of $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 7 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ 2 \\ 8 \end{pmatrix}$ is $(2 \cdot 8) + (7 \cdot 2) + (1 \cdot 8) = 16 + 14 + 8 = 38$.

###### **1.2.2 Geometric Interpretation**
The geometric view of the dot product relates to the concept of **projection**. The dot product of two vectors, $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, is the length of the projection of $\vec{w}$ onto $\vec{v}$, multiplied by the length of $\vec{v}$.
$$ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = (\text{Length of projected } \vec{w}) \times (\text{Length of } \vec{v}) $$
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
This interpretation provides insight into the relationship between the vectors:

-   **Positive Dot Product ($ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} > 0 $):** The vectors point in generally the same direction. The angle between them is less than 90 degrees.
-   **Zero Dot Product ($ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = 0 $):** The vectors are perpendicular (orthogonal). The projection of one onto the other has zero length.
-   **Negative Dot Product ($ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} < 0 $):** The vectors point in generally opposite directions. The angle between them is greater than 90 degrees.

###### **1.2.3 Symmetry of the Dot Product**
A key property of the dot product is that the order of the vectors does not matter: $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = \vec{w} \cdot \vec{v}$. This is obvious from the numerical calculation, but less so from the geometric projection definition. Projecting $\vec{w}$ onto $\vec{v}$ and multiplying by $||\vec{v}||$ feels different from projecting $\vec{v}$ onto $\vec{w}$ and multiplying by $||\vec{w}||$. The reason they are equivalent stems from the linearity of the operation.

##### **1.3 Duality: A Deeper Connection**
The true reason for the connection between the numerical and geometric views of the dot product lies in a concept called **duality**.

###### **1.3.1 Linear Transformations to One Dimension**
A linear transformation that maps a 2D vector to a 1D number can be represented by a **$1 \times 2$ matrix**. This transformation is completely determined by where the basis vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ land on the number line. For instance, if a transformation $L$ maps $\hat{i}$ to 2 and $\hat{j}$ to 1, its matrix is $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$. Applying this transformation to a vector $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$ is done through matrix-vector multiplication:
$$ \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = 2x + 1y $$

###### **1.3.2 The Dual Vector**
For any linear transformation from a vector space to the number line, there is a unique vector in that original space, called the **dual vector**, that is associated with it. Applying the transformation is equivalent to taking the dot product with this dual vector. In the example above, the dual vector is $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

###### **1.3.3 The Projection Transformation**
The act of projecting 2D vectors onto a specific line (defined by a unit vector $\hat{u}$) is a linear transformation. Its output is the length of the projected vector, which is a number. Therefore, this projection must have an associated dual vector.

The profound connection is this: the dual vector of this projection transformation *is the unit vector $\hat{u}$ itself*. The coordinates of $\hat{u}$ give the entries of the $1 \times 2$ matrix for the transformation. This means that projecting a vector $\vec{v}$ onto the line defined by $\hat{u}$ is the same as taking the dot product $\hat{u} \cdot \vec{v}$. This is the bridge that connects the two interpretations of the dot product.

#### **2. Definitions**
*   **Dot Product (Scalar Product)**: An operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors) and returns a single number. Geometrically, it is the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them.
*   **Vector Projection**: The vector component of one vector that lies in the direction of another vector. The length of this projection is a scalar value representing how much of the first vector points along the second.
*   **Duality**: A principle in mathematics where there is a natural-but-surprising correspondence between two different types of mathematical objects or concepts. In linear algebra, it often refers to the correspondence between vectors and linear maps from a vector space to its scalar field (e.g., the number line).
*   **Dual Vector**: For every linear transformation from a vector space to the number line, there is a unique corresponding vector in that space, called its dual vector. Applying the transformation is equivalent to taking the dot product with this dual vector.

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **Numerical Dot Product (2D)**: For $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} w_x \\ w_y \end{pmatrix}$, the dot product is
    $$ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = v_x w_x + v_y w_y $$
*   **Geometric Dot Product**:
    $$ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = ||\vec{v}|| \cdot ||\vec{w}|| \cos(\theta) $$
    where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors.
*   **Projection and Dot Product**:
    $$ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = ||\text{proj}_{\vec{v}}(\vec{w})|| \cdot ||\vec{v}|| $$
*   **Transformation Matrix (2D to 1D)**: A linear map $L$ from 2D space to the number line is represented by a $1 \times 2$ matrix whose columns are the numbers where the basis vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ land.
    $$ \text{Matrix for } L = \begin{pmatrix} L(\hat{i}) & L(\hat{j}) \end{pmatrix} $$

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Confusing Dot Product with Scalar Multiplication**: The dot product of two vectors results in a scalar (a single number), not another vector. Scalar multiplication, on the other hand, scales a vector, resulting in a new vector.
*   **Thinking the Dot Product is Only a Numerical Trick**: Failing to understand the geometric meaning of projection leads to missing its utility in physics, computer graphics, and understanding orthogonality.
*   **Assuming the Geometric Definition is Symmetric**: Projecting $\vec{v}$ onto $\vec{w}$ is geometrically different from projecting $\vec{w}$ onto $\vec{v}$. The final scalar result is the same, but the process is asymmetric. The symmetry is a consequence of linearity and duality.
*   **Incorrectly Calculating the Length of Projection**: The dot product $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}$ is not the length of the projection of $\vec{w}$ onto $\vec{v}$. It is the length of that projection multiplied by the length of $\vec{v}$.

</details>

##### **5.7. Non-Unit Vector Projection**
**Question:** Consider the dot product $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}$, where $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$. How does this relate to projection?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Identify the unit vector:** The unit vector in the direction of $\vec{v}$ is $\hat{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
2.  **Relate $\vec{v}$ to $\hat{u}$:** $\vec{v} = 4\hat{u}$.
3.  **Interpret the dot product:** Taking the dot product with $\vec{v}$ is the same as projecting a vector onto the line of $\vec{v}$ (which is the x-axis) and then scaling the result by the length of $\vec{v}$, which is 4.
    -   $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = (4\hat{u}) \cdot \vec{w} = 4(\hat{u} \cdot \vec{w})$
    -   $\hat{u} \cdot \vec{w}$ gives the length of the projection of $\vec{w}$ onto the x-axis.
    -   $4(\hat{u} \cdot \vec{w})$ scales that length by 4.

**Answer:** The dot product with $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ first projects a vector onto the x-axis and then scales the length of that projection by 4.
