#### **1. Summary**
##### **1.1 From Two to Three Dimensions**
The principles of linear transformations that apply in two-dimensional space extend directly to three dimensions. While 2D transformations are easier to visualize on a screen, understanding them provides a solid foundation for working with higher dimensions. A **linear transformation** in 3D is a mapping that takes 3D vectors as inputs and produces 3D vectors as outputs, while adhering to specific rules.

###### **1.1.1 The Rules of Linear Transformations**
A transformation is considered linear if it maintains the structure of the vector space. Visually, this means:
- The origin of the coordinate system remains fixed.
- All grid lines, which represent the vector space, remain parallel and are evenly spaced after the transformation.

This ensures that the transformation is consistent across the entire space. Any vector can be described as a linear combination of basis vectors, and the transformed vector is the same linear combination of the transformed basis vectors.

##### **1.2 Basis Vectors in 3D Space**
Just as in 2D, a 3D linear transformation is completely determined by where the **standard basis vectors** land. In three dimensions, we have three basis vectors, each representing a unit length along one of the primary axes:

- **$\hat{i}$** is the unit vector along the x-axis: $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
- **$\hat{j}$** is the unit vector along the y-axis: $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
- **$\hat{k}$** is the unit vector along the z-axis: $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

By tracking the destination of these three vectors, we can deduce the outcome of the transformation for any other vector in the space.

##### **1.3 The 3x3 Transformation Matrix**
A linear transformation in 3D is encoded by a **3x3 matrix**. This matrix is constructed by using the coordinates of the transformed basis vectors as its columns:

- The first column contains the coordinates of where **$\hat{i}$** lands.
- The second column contains the coordinates of where **$\hat{j}$** lands.
- The third column contains the coordinates of where **$\hat{k}$** lands.

This 3x3 matrix, containing nine numbers, fully describes the transformation.

##### **1.4 Applying the Transformation**
To find the destination of a vector $\vec{v}$ with coordinates $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}$, you multiply the transformation matrix by this vector. This operation is a weighted sum of the transformed basis vectors, where the weights are the components of $\vec{v}$:

*Transformed Vector* $= x \cdot (\text{transformed } \hat{i}) + y \cdot (\text{transformed } \hat{j}) + z \cdot (\text{transformed } \hat{k})$

This process is identical to the logic used in 2D transformations, but with an additional dimension and basis vector.

##### **1.5 Composition of Transformations**
Applying multiple linear transformations in sequence is known as **composition**. This corresponds to the multiplication of their respective matrices. The order of multiplication is crucial and works from right to left. If you first apply transformation $A$ and then transformation $B$, the resulting composite transformation is represented by the matrix product $B \cdot A$.

This concept is fundamental in fields like computer graphics and robotics, where complex movements and orientations are broken down into a series of simpler transformations like rotations and scaling.

#### **2. Definitions**
* **Linear Transformation (in 3D)**: A function that maps 3D vectors to other 3D vectors such that the origin remains fixed and grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced.
*   **3D Basis Vectors**: The set of three mutually perpendicular unit vectors, denoted as $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$, which point along the positive x, y, and z axes, respectively.
*   **3x3 Matrix**: A rectangular array of nine numbers arranged in three rows and three columns, used to represent a linear transformation in three-dimensional space.
*   **Composition of Transformations**: The process of applying one transformation followed by another. The composite transformation is represented by the product of their corresponding matrices.

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **3D Vector Representation**:
    $$ \vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k} $$
*   **3D Transformation Matrix-Vector Multiplication**:
    $$
    \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} =
    x \begin{pmatrix} a \\ d \\ g \end{pmatrix} +
    y \begin{pmatrix} b \\ e \\ h \end{pmatrix} +
    z \begin{pmatrix} c \\ f \\ i \end{pmatrix} =
    \begin{pmatrix} ax + by + cz \\ dx + ey + fz \\ gx + hy + iz \end{pmatrix}
    $$
    Where the columns $\begin{pmatrix} a \\ d \\ g \end{pmatrix}$, $\begin{pmatrix} b \\ e \\ h \end{pmatrix}$, and $\begin{pmatrix} c \\ f \\ i \end{pmatrix}$ are the transformed basis vectors $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$.

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Confusing the order of matrix multiplication for composite transformations:** Applying transformation A then B is calculated as $B \cdot A$, not $A \cdot B$. **Why it's wrong:** Matrix multiplication is not commutative, and the right-to-left order reflects the sequence of operations on the vector.
*   **Incorrectly constructing the transformation matrix:** Placing the transformed basis vectors into rows instead of columns. **Why it's wrong:** By convention, the columns of a transformation matrix define where the basis vectors land. Misplacing them will result in a completely different transformation (the transpose).
*   **Assuming translation is a linear transformation:** Shifting an object in space is not a linear transformation. **Why it's wrong:** Linear transformations must keep the origin fixed ($L(\vec{0}) = \vec{0}$). Translation moves the origin, violating this core requirement.
*   **Mixing up rotation axes:** Confusing a rotation around the x-axis with a rotation around the y- or z-axis. **Why it's wrong:** Each rotation affects the basis vectors differently. For example, a rotation around the y-axis leaves the $\hat{j}$ vector unchanged, while a rotation around the x-axis leaves the $\hat{i}$ vector unchanged.

#### **5. Examples**
##### **5.1. Rotation Matrix**
**Question:** Determine the 3x3 matrix for a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation around the y-axis.

1.  **Track $\hat{i}$:** The vector $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ on the x-axis rotates to the negative z-axis. Its new coordinates are $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$. This is the first column.
2.  **Track $\hat{j}$:** The vector $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is on the axis of rotation, so it does not move. Its new coordinates are $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$. This is the second column.
3.  **Track $\hat{k}$:** The vector $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ on the z-axis rotates to the positive x-axis. Its new coordinates are $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$. This is the third column.

**Answer:** The transformation matrix is **$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$**.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1. **Track $\hat{i}$:** $\hat{i} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is scaled by 3 to become $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
2. **Track $\hat{j}$:** $\hat{j} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is scaled by 0.5 to become $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0.5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
3. **Track $\hat{k}$:** $\hat{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is scaled by 2 to become $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$.

**Answer:** The transformation matrix is **$\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$**.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
Multiply the matrix by the vector:
$$ \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (3)(1) \\ (0.5)(4) \\ (2)(-2) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} $$

</details>

##### **5.5. Projection Matrix**
**Question:** Find the matrix that represents a projection of 3D space onto the xy-plane.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
This transformation sets the z-component of every vector to zero.
1. **Track $\hat{i}$:** $\hat{i} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is already on the xy-plane, so it stays at $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
2. **Track $\hat{j}$:** $\hat{j} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is also on the xy-plane, so it stays at $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
3. **Track $\hat{k}$:** $\hat{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected to the origin, becoming $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.

**Answer:** The projection matrix is **$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$**.
</details>

##### **5.6. Composite Transformation**
**Question:** Find the single matrix that represents a 90-degree rotation around the y-axis (from example 5.1) followed by a projection onto the xy-plane (from example 5.5).
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
Let the rotation matrix be $R_y$ and the projection matrix be $P_{xy}$. We want to find the composite matrix $C = P_{xy} \cdot R_y$. The transformation applied first (rotation) is on the right.
$$ C = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$
$$ C = \begin{pmatrix} 1(0)+0(0)+0(-1) & 1(0)+0(1)+0(0) & 1(1)+0(0)+0(0) \\ 0(0)+1(0)+0(-1) & 0(0)+1(1)+0(0) & 0(1)+1(0)+0(0) \\ 0(0)+0(0)+0(-1) & 0(0)+0(1)+0(0) & 0(1)+0(0)+0(0) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$

**Answer:** The composite matrix is **$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$**.
</details>

##### **5.7. Interpreting a Transformation Matrix**
**Question:** Given the transformation matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, describe what it does geometrically.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1. **Analyze the columns:**
    - First column $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$: $\hat{i}$ does not change.
    - Second column $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$: $\hat{j}$ moves to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$. It is shifted one unit in the x-direction.
    - Third column $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$: $\hat{k}$ does not change.
2.  **Describe the effect:** Since $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{k}$ are unchanged, the xz-plane is fixed. The $\hat{j}$ vector is tilted in the x-direction. This is a **shear** transformation. Every point is shifted in the x-direction by an amount proportional to its y-coordinate.

**Answer:** The matrix represents a shear transformation that slants the y-axis toward the positive x-axis.
