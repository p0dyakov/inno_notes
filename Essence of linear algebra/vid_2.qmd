#### **1. Summary**
##### **1.1 Vector Coordinates as Scalars**
Each number in a vector's coordinates can be interpreted as a **scalar** that stretches or squishes a fundamental vector. For a 2D vector like $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$, the `3` scales the horizontal base vector, and the `-2` scales the vertical base vector.

##### **1.2 Basis Vectors**
In the standard XY coordinate system, there are two special, fundamental vectors called **basis vectors**:
- **î**: The unit vector in the x-direction, with coordinates $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
- **ĵ**: The unit vector in the y-direction, with coordinates $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

Any vector can be expressed as a sum of scaled versions of these basis vectors. For example, the vector $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ is the sum of `î` scaled by 3 and `ĵ` scaled by -2.
$$ \vec{v} = 3\hat{\imath} + (-2)\hat{\jmath} $$
This concept is crucial because it allows us to define a coordinate system with different basis vectors, leading to alternative ways of representing the same vector.

##### **1.3 Linear Combinations**
A **linear combination** of two vectors, $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, is the operation of scaling each vector by a scalar and then adding them together. The general form is:
$$ a\vec{v} + b\vec{w} $$
Here, `a` and `b` are scalars. The resulting vector is a new vector created from the combination of the original two.

##### **1.4 Span**
The **span** of a set of vectors is the set of *all possible vectors* that can be reached by forming a linear combination of them. When the scalars can be any real number, the span represents all the points you can get to.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.4.1 Span in 2D**
- **Two non-collinear vectors:** If two 2D vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ point in different directions, their span is the entire 2D plane. You can reach any point in the plane by choosing the right scalars `a` and `b`.
- **Two collinear vectors:** If two 2D vectors lie on the same line (one is a scalar multiple of the other), their span is just that line passing through the origin.

###### **1.4.2 Span in 3D**
- **Two non-collinear vectors:** The span of two 3D vectors that point in different directions is a flat plane that passes through the origin in 3D space.
- **Three vectors:**
    - If a third vector is added that already lies on the plane spanned by the first two, the span doesn't change; it's still just that plane.
    - If the third vector points in a different direction (off the plane), their combined span is the entire 3D space.

##### **1.5 Linear Dependence vs. Independence**
- **Linearly Dependent:** A set of vectors is **linearly dependent** if at least one vector is redundant, meaning it can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. This vector does not add a new dimension to the span. For example, if $\vec{u}$ is in the span of $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, the set $\{\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w}\}$ is linearly dependent.
- **Linearly Independent:** A set of vectors is **linearly independent** if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. Each vector contributes a new dimension to the span.

##### **1.6 Basis (Technical Definition)**
The **basis** of a vector space is a set of *linearly independent* vectors that *span* the entire space.
- For 2D space, you need two linearly independent vectors (e.g., `î` and `ĵ`).
- For 3D space, you need three linearly independent vectors.

#### **2. Definitions**
*   **Scalar**: A single numerical quantity that scales a vector (stretching, shrinking, or reversing it).
*   **Vector**: A mathematical object with both magnitude and direction, often represented as an arrow from an origin.
*   **Basis Vectors**: A set of linearly independent vectors whose span is the entire vector space. The standard basis in 2D is {`î`, `ĵ`}.
*   **Linear Combination**: The sum of scaled vectors, such as $a\vec{v} + b\vec{w}$, where `a` and `b` are scalars. [2]
*   **Span**: The set of all possible vectors that can be created from a linear combination of a given set of vectors. [4, 8]
*   **Linearly Dependent**: A set of vectors where at least one vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. Intuitively, one of the vectors is redundant and doesn't add to the span.
*   **Linearly Independent**: A set of vectors where no vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. Each vector adds a new dimension to the span. [1]

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **Linear Combination of Two Vectors**:
    $$ a\vec{v} + b\vec{w} $$
*   **Linear Combination of Three Vectors**:
    $$ a\vec{v} + b\vec{w} + c\vec{u} $$
*   **Condition for Linear Dependence (for three vectors)**: The set $\{\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w}\}$ is linearly dependent if there exist scalars `a` and `b` such that:
    $$ \vec{u} = a\vec{v} + b\vec{w} $$
*   **Condition for Linear Independence (for three vectors)**: The set is linearly independent if for all possible scalar values of `a` and `b`:
    $$ \vec{u} \neq a\vec{v} + b\vec{w} $$

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Assuming any two vectors span a 2D plane:** If the two vectors are collinear (point along the same line), their span is only that line, not the entire plane.
*   **Confusing a vector with a point:** While we often represent the span as a collection of points (the tips of the vectors), the underlying concept is about the vectors themselves, which have both magnitude and direction.
*   **Assuming a third vector in 3D always expands the span:** If the third vector is linearly dependent on the first two (i.e., it lies in the plane they span), it adds nothing to the span. The span remains a 2D plane.
*   **Believing the basis for a space is unique:** Any set of linearly independent vectors that spans the space can serve as a basis. The standard basis (`î`, `ĵ`) is just the most common and convenient choice.

#### **5. Examples**
##### **5.1. Linear Combination in 2D**
**Question:** Calculate the linear combination $2\vec{v} - 3\vec{w}$ for vectors $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$.

1.  **Scale each vector:** Multiply vector $\vec{v}$ by scalar 2 and vector $\vec{w}$ by scalar -3.
    $$ 2\vec{v} = 2\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} $$
    $$ -3\vec{w} = -3\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -12 \end{pmatrix} $$
2.  **Add the resulting vectors:**
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -12 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4+3 \\ 2-12 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ -10 \end{pmatrix} $$

**Answer:** The resulting vector is **$\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ -10 \end{pmatrix}$**.

##### **5.2. Describing the Span of Two 2D Vectors**
**Question:** Describe the span of the vectors $\vec{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Check for linear independence:** Determine if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other. Is there a scalar `c` such that $\vec{v} = c\vec{u}$?
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = c\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \implies 3 = c \cdot 1 \text{ and } 1 = c \cdot 2 $$
    From the first equation, $c=3$. From the second, $c=0.5$. Since there is no single value for `c`, the vectors are not collinear and are therefore linearly independent.
2.  **Determine the span:** Since we have two linearly independent vectors in a 2D space ($R^2$), they form a basis for that space.

**Answer:** The span of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ is the entire 2D plane ($R^2$).
</details>

##### **5.3. Describing the Span of Collinear Vectors**
**Question:** Describe the span of the vectors $\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Check for linear dependence:** Observe if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other.
    $$ \vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = -2\vec{a} $$
    Since $\vec{b}$ is a scalar multiple of $\vec{a}$, the vectors are linearly dependent (collinear).
2.  **Determine the span:** The linear combination of two collinear vectors can only produce other vectors on the same line.

**Answer:** The span is the line passing through the origin defined by the direction of vector $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$.
</details>

##### **5.4. Checking for Linear Dependence in 3D**
**Question:** Is the vector $\vec{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 7 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ in the span of $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Set up the linear combination equation:** We need to find if there exist scalars `a` and `b` such that $\vec{u} = a\vec{v} + b\vec{w}$.
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 7 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = a\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + b\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a + 2b \\ 2a + b \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} $$
2.  **Create a system of equations from the components:**
    - $7 = a + 2b$
    - $7 = 2a + b$
    - $0 = 0$ (This last equation is trivial and provides no information).
3.  **Solve the system:** From the second equation, $b = 7 - 2a$. Substitute this into the first equation:
    $$ 7 = a + 2(7 - 2a) \implies 7 = a + 14 - 4a \implies -7 = -3a \implies a = \frac{7}{3} $$
    Now solve for `b`:
    $$ b = 7 - 2(\frac{7}{3}) = 7 - \frac{14}{3} = \frac{21-14}{3} = \frac{7}{3} $$
    Since we found a valid solution for `a` and `b`, the vector is in the span.

**Answer:** Yes, $\vec{u}$ is in the span of $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$. The set of three vectors is linearly dependent.

##### **5.5. Span of Two 3D Vectors**
**Question:** What geometric object is described by the span of $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Check for linear independence:** The vectors are not scalar multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent.
2.  **Determine the span:** The span of two linearly independent vectors in 3D space is the set of all their linear combinations, which forms a 2D plane passing through the origin.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

**Answer:** A plane in 3D space that contains the origin, $\vec{v}$, and $\vec{w}$.
</details>

##### **5.6. Linearly Independent Vectors as a Basis**
**Question:** Do the vectors $\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ form a basis for $R^2$?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Check for linear independence:** The vectors are not scalar multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent.
2.  **Check if they span the space:** Since we have two linearly independent vectors in a 2-dimensional space, they must span the entire space.

**Answer:** Yes, they form a basis for $R^2$ because they are a set of two linearly independent vectors in a 2D space.
</details>

##### **5.7. A Linearly Dependent Set**
**Question:** Is the set of vectors $\{\vec{a}, \vec{b}, \vec{c}\}$ with $\vec{a}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$, $\vec{b}=\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}$, $\vec{c}=\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ linearly independent or dependent?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Analyze the relationship between vectors:** We can quickly see that $\vec{b} = -2\vec{a}$.
2.  **Conclusion:** Since one vector ($\vec{b}$) can be written as a linear combination (in this case, just a scaling) of another vector ($\vec{a}$), the set contains a redundant vector.

**Answer:** The set is linearly dependent.
