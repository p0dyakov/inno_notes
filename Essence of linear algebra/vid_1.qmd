##### **1.1 What is a Vector?**

The fundamental building block of linear algebra is the **vector**. To understand linear algebra, it's crucial to grasp what a vector is from multiple perspectives, as different fields interpret them in ways that are most useful for their applications. Broadly, there are three key perspectives: that of a physics student, a computer science student, and a mathematician.

###### **1.1.1 The Physics Perspective: Arrows in Space**

From a physics standpoint, a **vector** is best understood as an **arrow in space**. This arrow possesses two fundamental properties:

*   ***Length***: Also known as **magnitude**, this represents the size or quantity the vector describes (e.g., speed, force).
*   ***Direction***: This indicates the orientation of the vector in space.

A key concept in this view is that a vector is not tied to a specific location. You can move a vector anywhere in space, and as long as its length and direction remain unchanged, it is considered the same vector. Vectors existing on a flat surface are called **two-dimensional vectors**, while those in the space we live in are **three-dimensional vectors**.

###### **1.1.2 The Computer Science Perspective: Lists of Numbers**

In computer science and data analysis, a **vector** is conceptualized as an **ordered list of numbers**. This perspective is highly practical for organizing and manipulating data.

For example, if you were analyzing house prices, you might only care about two features: square footage and price. A specific house could be represented by a two-dimensional vector where the first number is its area and the second is its cost.

*   A house of `2,600` square feet priced at `$300,000` could be represented as the vector $\begin{bmatrix} 2600 \\ 300,000 \end{bmatrix}$.

In this context, the *order of the numbers is crucial*. Reversing the numbers would completely change the meaning of the data. The "dimension" of the vector simply refers to how many numbers are in the list. Here, "vector" is essentially a synonym for "list."

###### **1.1.3 The Mathematician's Perspective: A Generalization**

A mathematician seeks to generalize both of these ideas. From this abstract viewpoint, a **vector** can be any object, as long as two fundamental operations can be sensibly applied to it:

1.  **Vector Addition**: Combining two vectors to produce a third vector.
2.  **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying a vector by a number (a **scalar**) to produce another vector.

Essentially, anything that consistently follows the rules of these two operations can be treated as a vector. This abstract definition allows the principles of linear algebra to be applied to a wide range of concepts, including functions, not just arrows or lists of numbers.

##### **1.2 Vectors in a Coordinate System**

Linear algebra powerfully bridges the gap between the geometric (physics) and numerical (computer science) perspectives. The most effective way to do this is to think of vectors as arrows originating from a central point, the **origin**, within a **coordinate system**.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

*   In a 2D system, we have a horizontal **x-axis** and a vertical **y-axis**.
*   In a 3D system, a **z-axis** is added, perpendicular to both the x and y axes.

When a vector's tail is placed at the origin, its tip points to a unique location. The coordinates of this tip become the numerical representation of the vector. For a 2D vector, its coordinates are a pair of numbers that provide instructions for reaching its tip from the origin:

1.  The first number indicates movement along the x-axis (positive for right, negative for left).
2.  The second number indicates movement along the y-axis (positive for up, negative for down).

By convention, a vector's coordinates are written vertically in square brackets, such as $\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$, to distinguish them from the coordinates of a point, which are typically written as $(3, -1)$.

##### **1.3 Fundamental Vector Operations**

All of linear algebra is built upon two core operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication.

###### **1.3.1 Vector Addition**

- **Geometric View**: To add two vectors, $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, we use the *tip-to-tail* method. Place the tail of $\vec{w}$ at the tip of $\vec{v}$. The resulting sum, $\vec{v} + \vec{w}$, is the new vector drawn from the tail of $\vec{v}$ to the new tip of $\vec{w}$. This can be thought of as applying one movement after another, with the sum being the overall, direct path from the start to the end.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

- **Numerical View**: The numerical representation is incredibly straightforward. You simply add the corresponding components of the two vectors.
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2 \\ y_1 + y_2 \end{bmatrix}
  $$

###### **1.3.2 Scalar Multiplication**

- **Geometric View**: Multiplying a vector by a number (a **scalar**) is called **scaling**. This operation stretches, squishes, or reverses the vector without changing its fundamental direction (or simply reversing it).
    - Multiplying by `2` makes the vector twice as long.
    - Multiplying by `1/3` makes it one-third as long.
    - Multiplying by a negative number (e.g., `-1.8`) flips the vector's direction and then scales its length.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

- **Numerical View**: To perform scalar multiplication numerically, you multiply every component in the vector by that scalar.
  $$
  c \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} c \cdot x \\ c \cdot y \end{bmatrix}
  $$

#### **2. Definitions**
*   **Vector**: A mathematical object that has both magnitude (length) and direction. It can be represented geometrically as an arrow or numerically as an ordered list of coordinates.
*   **Scalar**: A single numerical quantity (like `2`, `1/3`, or `-1.8`) that is used to scale vectors. In linear algebra, the term is used to distinguish numbers from vectors.
*   **Origin**: The zero point `(0,0)` in a coordinate system where the axes intersect. It serves as the standard starting point (tail) for vectors.
*   **Vector Addition**: The operation of combining two vectors. Geometrically, this is visualized by placing the vectors tip-to-tail. Numerically, it is done by adding their corresponding components.
*   **Scalar Multiplication**: The operation of multiplying a vector by a scalar. This scales the vector's length by the scalar's value and reverses its direction if the scalar is negative.
*   **Coordinates (of a vector)**: The set of numbers that describe a vector's displacement from the origin along each axis.

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **Vector Addition**: For two vectors $\vec{u} = \begin{bmatrix} u_x \\ u_y \end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \end{bmatrix}$, their sum is:
    $$ \vec{u} + \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} u_x + v_x \\ u_y + v_y \end{bmatrix} $$
*   **Scalar Multiplication**: For a scalar `c` and a vector $\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \end{bmatrix}$, the product is:
    $$ c\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} c \cdot v_x \\ c \cdot v_y \end{bmatrix} $$

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Confusing Vectors and Points:** While a vector rooted at the origin points to a location, a vector itself represents displacement (a journey), not a fixed point (a destination).
*   **Adding Vectors of Different Dimensions:** You cannot add a 2D vector to a 3D vector. **Why it's wrong:** The operation relies on adding corresponding components, and the vectors do not have the same number of components.
*   **Ignoring Component Order:** Treating the vector $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ as the same as $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$. **Why it's wrong:** The order defines the movement along each specific axis; changing it results in a completely different vector.
*   **Adding a Scalar to a Vector:** Trying to compute $\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} + 5$. **Why it's wrong:** This is an undefined operation. Scalars and vectors are different mathematical objects and cannot be added together. A scalar can only multiply (scale) a vector.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

The total displacement is the sum of the individual displacement vectors.
1.  **Set up the addition:**
    $$ \vec{a} + \vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} $$
2.  **Add the corresponding components:**
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} 5 + (-3) \\ 2 + 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} $$

**Answer:** The vector representing the final position is $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$. This means the robot is 2 units east and 6 units north of its starting point.
