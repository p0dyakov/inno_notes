#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 The Determinant as a Scaling Factor**
Linear transformations can stretch or squish space. The **determinant** is a measure of exactly how much a transformation scales area. It is the factor by which the area of any given region increases or decreases.

-   **Stretching Space:** Some transformations expand space, increasing the area of shapes.
-   **Squishing Space:** Other transformations compress space, decreasing the area of shapes.

To quantify this, we can examine what happens to a simple shape. Consider a 1x1 square defined by the basis vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$. The area of this square is 1. After applying a linear transformation, this square is transformed into a parallelogram. The area of this new parallelogram is the determinant of the transformation.

This scaling factor is consistent for any area in the space. The reason is that a linear transformation keeps grid lines parallel and evenly spaced. Therefore, any shape can be approximated by a collection of tiny grid squares, and each of these squares will be scaled by the same amount. As a result, the total area of the shape is scaled by that same factor.

###### **1.1.1 Example of Area Scaling**
Consider a transformation represented by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$.

-   The first basis vector, $\hat{i}$, lands on $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
-   The second basis vector, $\hat{j}$, lands on $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$.
-   The original 1x1 unit square becomes a 3x2 rectangle.

The area of this new rectangle is $3 \times 2 = 6$. The transformation has scaled the area by a factor of 6. Thus, the determinant of this matrix is 6.

###### **1.1.2 Example of Shear**
A shear transformation represented by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ provides a different outcome.

-   $\hat{i}$ remains at $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
-   $\hat{j}$ moves to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
-   The unit square is transformed into a parallelogram.

However, the base and height of this parallelogram are both still 1, so its area remains 1. The determinant is 1, indicating that this transformation preserves area, even though it changes the shape of objects.

##### **1.2 Orientation and Negative Determinants**
The **determinant** can also be negative. This introduces the concept of *orientation*.

-   **Positive Determinant:** The orientation of space is preserved.
-   **Negative Determinant:** The orientation of space is inverted or flipped.

In two dimensions, orientation can be visualized by the relative positions of the basis vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$. Typically, $\hat{j}$ is 90 degrees counter-clockwise from $\hat{i}$. After a transformation, if the new $\hat{j}$ is now to the *right* of the new $\hat{i}$, the orientation has been flipped. This is like turning over a sheet of paper.

When a transformation flips the orientation, its determinant will be negative. The *absolute value* of the determinant still tells us the factor by which the area has been scaled. For example, a determinant of -2 means the orientation was flipped, and areas were scaled by a factor of 2.

##### **1.3 The Determinant in Three Dimensions**
The concept of the determinant extends naturally to three dimensions, but instead of scaling *areas*, it measures the scaling of *volumes*.

-   The reference shape is the 1x1x1 cube whose edges are the basis vectors $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$.
-   After a 3D linear transformation, this cube is transformed into a slanted, cube-like shape called a **parallelepiped**.
-   The determinant of the transformation is the volume of this parallelepiped.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.3.1 Orientation in 3D**
In three dimensions, orientation is determined by the **right-hand rule**.

1.  Point the index finger of your right hand in the direction of $\hat{i}$.
2.  Point your middle finger in the direction of $\hat{j}$.
3.  Your thumb will naturally point in the direction of $\hat{k}$.

If, after a transformation, the transformed basis vectors still follow the right-hand rule, the orientation is preserved, and the determinant is positive. If you must use your left hand to make the same configuration, the orientation has been flipped, and the determinant is negative.

##### **1.4 Determinant of Zero**
If the determinant of a transformation is zero, it means the transformation squishes all of space into a lower dimension.

-   In 2D, a determinant of zero means all of space is compressed onto a single line or a point. The "area" of this line is zero.
-   In 3D, a determinant of zero means all of space is compressed onto a plane, a line, or a point. The "volume" of these shapes is zero.

This occurs when the columns of the transformation matrix are **linearly dependent**. This means the basis vectors are transformed in a way that they no longer span the full space (e.g., in 2D, they land on the same line).

#### **2. Definitions**
*   **Determinant**: A scalar value that describes how a linear transformation scales area (in 2D) or volume (in 3D). Its sign indicates whether the orientation of space is preserved or inverted.
*   **Orientation**: In 2D, the relative positioning of the basis vectors ($\hat{j}$ is to the left of $\hat{i}$). In 3D, it is determined by the right-hand rule. A transformation that flips this arrangement has a negative determinant.
*   **Parallelepiped**: The 3D analogue of a parallelogram. It is a polyhedron with six faces, each of which is a parallelogram.
*   **Right-Hand Rule**: A convention used in 3D to define orientation. If the index finger represents the transformed $\hat{i}$ and the middle finger represents the transformed $\hat{j}$, a positive orientation means the thumb points in the direction of the transformed $\hat{k}$.

#### **3. Formulas**
*   **Determinant of a 2x2 Matrix**: For a matrix $M = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$, the determinant is:
    $$ \det(M) = ad - bc $$
*   **Determinant of a 3x3 Matrix**: For a matrix $M = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i \end{pmatrix}$, the determinant is:
    $$ \det(M) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) $$
*   **Multiplicative Property of Determinants**: For any two square matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$ of the same size, the determinant of their product is the product of their determinants:
    $$ \det(M_1 M_2) = \det(M_1) \det(M_2) $$

#### **4. Mistakes**
*   **Confusing the determinant with the matrix:** The determinant is a single number that describes a property of the matrix's transformation, not the matrix itself. **Why it's wrong:** A matrix represents the full transformation, while the determinant is just one aspect of it (the area/volume scaling factor).
*   **Assuming the determinant is always positive:** The sign of the determinant is crucial. **Why it's wrong:** A negative determinant indicates that the transformation inverts the orientation of space, which is a key geometric insight.
*   **Forgetting that a zero determinant implies linear dependence:** A determinant of zero is not just a number; it signals a fundamental property of the transformation. **Why it's wrong:** It means the transformation reduces the dimensionality of the space (e.g., a 2D plane is squished into a 1D line), which happens if and only if the columns of the matrix are linearly dependent.
*   **Misinterpreting the `ad - bc` formula:** The formula is a calculation, but the intuition behind it is geometric. **Why it's wrong:** Simply memorizing the formula without understanding that it represents how a unit area changes under transformation misses the core concept of what a determinant is.

##### **5.4 Zero Determinant**
**Question:** What is the determinant of $M = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 6 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$? What does this imply about the columns of the matrix?
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
