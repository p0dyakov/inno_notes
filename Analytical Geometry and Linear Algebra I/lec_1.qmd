#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Introduction to Vectors**
A **vector** is a fundamental mathematical object that possesses both *magnitude* (or length) and *direction*. It's distinct from a **scalar**, which is a simple numerical value (like temperature or speed) that has magnitude but no direction. Think of a vector as an instruction to travel a certain distance in a specific direction.

Vectors can be represented in several ways:

###### **1.1.1 Geometric Representation**
As a directed line segment, or an arrow, in space. The arrow's length represents the magnitude, and the direction it points represents its direction. A key property is that a vector is *independent of its starting position*; two arrows with the same length and direction represent the same vector, regardless of where they are in space. This makes them "free-floating" instructions.

###### **1.1.2 Algebraic Representation**
As an ordered list of numbers, called **components**. For instance, in a 2D plane (denoted $\mathbb{R}^2$), a vector is represented by two components $(x, y)$, and in 3D space ($\mathbb{R}^3$), by three components $(x, y, z)$. These components correspond to the vector's projection onto the coordinate axes. By convention in linear algebra, vectors are often written as **column vectors**:
$$ \vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} $$
A **row vector** is written as $(x, y)$. The two are not interchangeable, but one can be converted to the other using the *transpose* operation: $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}^T = (x, y)$.

###### **1.1.3 Vector Notation**
Vectors can be denoted by bold lowercase letters (e.g., **v**), a letter with an arrow above it (e.g., $\vec{v}$), or by their start and end points (e.g., $\vec{AB}$, representing the vector from point A to point B). Points are denoted by capital letters (e.g., A, B). Scalars are denoted by regular lowercase letters (e.g., c, k, $\alpha$).

##### **1.2 Basic Vector Operations**
Standard arithmetic operations are defined for vectors, allowing them to be manipulated algebraically.

###### **1.2.1 Vector Addition**
To add two vectors, you add their corresponding components. Geometrically, this is represented by the *tip-to-tail method*: place the tail of the second vector at the tip of the first. The resulting vector (the sum) goes from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second, forming a triangle.
$$ \vec{u} + \vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 + v_1 \\ u_2 + v_2 \end{pmatrix} $$
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.2.2 Scalar Multiplication**
To multiply a vector by a scalar, you multiply each of its components by that scalar. This operation *scales* the vector, changing its magnitude. If the scalar is positive, the direction remains the same. If negative, the direction is reversed. A scalar of 2 doubles the vector's length; a scalar of -0.5 halves its length and flips its direction.
$$ c\vec{v} = c\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} cv_1 \\ cv_2 \end{pmatrix} $$

###### **1.2.3 Vector Subtraction**
Subtraction is defined as adding the negative of a vector. That is, $\vec{u} - \vec{v}$ is the same as $\vec{u} + (-1)\vec{v}$. Geometrically, the vector $\vec{u} - \vec{v}$ is the vector that points from the tip of $\vec{v}$ to the tip of $\vec{u}$.
$$ \vec{u} - \vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 - v_1 \\ u_2 - v_2 \end{pmatrix} $$

##### **1.3 Vector Magnitude and Normalization**

###### **1.3.1 Norm of a Vector**
The **norm** (or magnitude/length) of a vector is a non-negative scalar value representing its length. It is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem on its components. The norm of a vector $\vec{v}$ is denoted as $||\vec{v}||$.
$$ ||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \dots + v_n^2} $$

###### **1.3.2 Unit Vectors**
A **unit vector** is any vector with a norm of 1. It is useful for representing a pure direction without any magnitude. To **normalize** a non-zero vector (i.e., to find the unit vector in its direction), you divide the vector by its own norm.
$$ \hat{u} = \frac{\vec{v}}{||\vec{v}||} $$

###### **1.3.3 Standard Unit Vectors**
In Cartesian coordinate systems, there are special unit vectors that point along the axes. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, these are:

*   $\vec{i} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ (along the x-axis)
*   $\vec{j} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ (along the y-axis)
*   $\vec{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ (along the z-axis)
Any vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be written as a sum of these: $\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix} = a\vec{i} + b\vec{j} + c\vec{k}$.

###### **1.3.4 Distance Between Points**
The straight-line distance between two points, say $P$ and $Q$, can be found by first calculating the vector $\vec{PQ}$ that connects them ($\vec{PQ} = Q - P$) and then finding the norm of that vector.
$$ d(P, Q) = ||\vec{PQ}|| = ||Q - P|| = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2 + \dots} $$

##### **1.4 Vector Spaces and Subspaces**

###### **1.4.1 Vector Space**
A **vector space** is a collection of objects (called vectors) for which the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined and satisfy a set of ten rules, known as axioms. These axioms ensure that vectors behave consistently and predictably. Key axioms include *closure* (adding two vectors or multiplying by a scalar results in a vector still within the space), the existence of a **zero vector** ($\vec{0}$), and the existence of an **additive inverse** (e.g., $-\vec{v}$) for every vector.

*   **Examples of Vector Spaces**:
    *   $\mathbb{R}^n$: The set of all n-dimensional vectors with real number components. This is the most common example.
    *   $P_n$: The set of all polynomials of degree at most $n$. For example, $3x^2 - x + 5$ is a vector in $P_2$.
    *   The set of all continuous functions.
*   **Non-Example**: The set of all vectors in the first quadrant of $\mathbb{R}^2$ (where $x \ge 0, y \ge 0$) is *not* a vector space because it fails closure under scalar multiplication. Multiplying a vector in the first quadrant by -1 results in a vector in the third quadrant, which is outside the set.

###### **1.4.2 Subspace**
A **subspace** is a subset of a larger vector space that is itself a vector space. To verify if a subset is a subspace, a simplified test called the **Subspace Test** is used. A subset $H$ is a subspace if it meets three conditions:

1.  It contains the **zero vector**.
2.  It is **closed under addition** (if $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are in $H$, then $\vec{u} + \vec{v}$ must also be in $H$).
3.  It is **closed under scalar multiplication** (if $\vec{u}$ is in $H$ and $c$ is any scalar, then $c\vec{u}$ must also be in $H$).
*   **Key Examples of Subspaces**:
    *   Any line or plane passing through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
    *   The **null space** of a matrix A, which is the set of all solutions to the homogeneous equation $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$, is always a subspace.

###### **1.4.3 Centroid of a Triangle**
For a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C, the **centroid** (or center of mass) is the unique point G such that the vectors from G to each vertex sum to the zero vector: $\vec{GA} + \vec{GB} + \vec{GC} = \vec{0}$. The position vector of the centroid is the average of the position vectors of its vertices: $\vec{OG} = \frac{1}{3}(\vec{OA} + \vec{OB} + \vec{OC})$. The centroid is always located inside the triangle.

##### **1.5 Linear Combinations, Span, and Basis**

###### **1.5.1 Linear Combination and Span**
A **linear combination** is a new vector formed by adding together scalar multiples of other vectors. For example, $\vec{w} = c_1\vec{v}_1 + c_2\vec{v}_2$ is a linear combination of $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$. The **span** of a set of vectors is the set of *all possible* linear combinations that can be formed from them. The span of a set of vectors always forms a vector space (or a subspace). For instance, the span of two non-collinear vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a plane passing through the origin.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.5.2 Linear Independence**
A set of vectors is **linearly independent** if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. This means that none of the vectors are redundant; each one contributes a unique direction. The only way to form the zero vector from a linear combination of linearly independent vectors is if all the scalar coefficients are zero (the *trivial solution*).

###### **1.5.3 Linear Dependence**
A set of vectors is **linearly dependent** if at least one vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. This indicates redundancy in the set. Geometrically, two vectors are linearly dependent if they lie on the same line, and three vectors are linearly dependent if they lie on the same plane.

###### **1.5.4 Basis and Dimension**
A **basis** of a vector space is a set of vectors that is both *linearly independent* and *spans the entire space*. A basis provides a minimal set of "building blocks" for the space. While a vector space can have many different bases, the number of vectors in every basis for that space is always the same. This unique number is called the **dimension** of the vector space. For example, the dimension of $\mathbb{R}^3$ is 3, because a standard basis for it is the set of three vectors: $\{\vec{i}, \vec{j}, \vec{k}\}$.

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Vector**: A mathematical object that has both magnitude (length) and direction.
*   **Scalar**: A quantity that is fully described by a magnitude alone (a single number).
*   **Norm**: The length or magnitude of a vector, denoted by $||\vec{v}||$.
*   **Unit Vector**: A vector with a norm of 1, often used to represent direction.
*   **Standard Unit Vectors**: The vectors $\vec{i}, \vec{j}, \vec{k}$ that form the basis for the Cartesian coordinate system.
*   **Vector Space**: A collection of vectors and a field of scalars that satisfy a set of ten axioms, defining a consistent system for vector addition and scalar multiplication.
*   **Subspace**: A subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space under the same operations.
*   **Null Space**: The set of all vectors $\vec{x}$ that are solutions to the homogeneous equation $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$. The null space of a matrix is always a subspace.
*   **Centroid**: The point in a triangle where the medians intersect; its position vector is the average of the vertices' position vectors.
*   **Linear Combination**: A sum of vectors, each multiplied by a scalar coefficient.
*   **Span**: The set of all possible linear combinations of a given set of vectors. The span of a set of vectors is always a subspace.
*   **Linearly Independent**: A set of vectors where no vector can be written as a linear combination of the others.
*   **Linearly Dependent**: A set of vectors where at least one vector can be written as a linear combination of the others.
*   **Basis**: A set of vectors that is both linearly independent and spans the vector space. It is a minimal generating set for the space.
*   **Dimension**: The number of vectors in any basis for a vector space.

#### **3. Formulas**

*   **Vector Addition**: $\vec{u} + \vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 + v_1 \\ u_2 + v_2 \end{pmatrix}$
*   **Scalar Multiplication**: $c\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} cv_1 \\ cv_2 \end{pmatrix}$
*   **Vector Subtraction**: $\vec{u} - \vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 - v_1 \\ u_2 - v_2 \end{pmatrix}$
*   **Norm of a Vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$**: $||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \dots + v_n^2}$
*   **Distance between Points P and Q**: $d(P, Q) = ||Q - P||$
*   **Normalization (Unit Vector)**: $\hat{u} = \frac{\vec{v}}{||\vec{v}||}$
*   **Position Vector of Centroid G**: $\vec{OG} = \frac{1}{3}(\vec{OA} + \vec{OB} + \vec{OC})$
*   **Projection of vector $\vec{a}$ onto vector $\vec{b}$**: $\text{proj}_{\vec{b}}\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{||\vec{b}||^2} \vec{b}$
*   **Reflection of vector $\vec{a}$ over a line defined by vector $\vec{b}$**: $\text{ref}_{\vec{b}}\vec{a} = 2 \cdot \text{proj}_{\vec{b}}\vec{a} - \vec{a}$

#### **4. Mistakes**

*   **Adding a scalar and a vector:** An operation like $5 + \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ is undefined. **Why it's wrong:** Scalars and vectors are fundamentally different types of mathematical objects and cannot be directly added. You can only perform scalar *multiplication*.
*   **Assuming any set of n vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a basis:** For example, the set $\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\}$ is not a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$. **Why it's wrong:** A basis must be linearly independent. In this case, the second vector is just twice the first, so they are linearly dependent and only span a line, not the entire plane.
*   **Confusing a subspace with any subset:** A line in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that does not pass through the origin is a subset, but not a subspace. **Why it's wrong:** A subspace must contain the zero vector and be closed under addition and scalar multiplication. A line not through the origin fails the zero vector test.
*   **Mixing up linear independence and spanning:** A set of vectors can be linearly independent but not span the entire space. For example, $\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\}$ is a linearly independent set in $\mathbb{R}^3$, but it only spans the xy-plane, not all of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
*   **Incorrectly calculating the dot product:** The dot product of two vectors results in a scalar, not another vector. **Why it's wrong:** The definition of the dot product is $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \dots$, which is a sum of products, resulting in a single number.
*   **Forgetting to take the square root for the norm:** The norm is the length, which is the square root of the sum of squared components. A common mistake is to forget the square root, which calculates the squared norm $||\vec{v}||^2$.

#### **5. Examples**

##### **5.1. Vector Equality**
**Question:** Given points $A(-1, 1)$, $B(3, 5)$, $C(x, y)$, and $D(2x, 1)$, find the values of $x$ and $y$ such that the vector $\vec{AB}$ is equal to the vector $\vec{CD}$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Calculate the components of vector $\vec{AB}$:**
    $$ \vec{AB} = B - A = \begin{pmatrix} 3 - (-1) \\ 5 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} $$
2.  **Calculate the components of vector $\vec{CD}$ in terms of $x$ and $y$:**
    $$ \vec{CD} = D - C = \begin{pmatrix} 2x - x \\ 1 - y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 1 - y \end{pmatrix} $$
3.  **Set the two vectors equal to each other:** For two vectors to be equal, their corresponding components must be equal.
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 1 - y \end{pmatrix} $$
4.  **Solve the resulting system of equations:**
    *   From the first component: $x = 4$.
    *   From the second component: $4 = 1 - y \implies y = 1 - 4 \implies y = -3$.

**Answer:** The coordinates are **$x=4, y=-3$**.
</details>

##### **5.2. Subspace Test (Failure)**
**Question:** Show that the set $S$ of all vectors in the first quadrant of $\mathbb{R}^2$ (i.e., all vectors $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$ where $x \ge 0$ and $y \ge 0$) does not form a vector space.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **To be a vector space, $S$ must satisfy all subspace conditions.** We only need to find one condition that fails. Let's check closure under scalar multiplication.
2.  **Choose a vector in the set $S$.** Let's pick $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$. Since $3 \ge 0$ and $5 \ge 0$, this vector is in $S$.
3.  **Choose a scalar that might cause a problem.** Let's pick a negative scalar, $c = -2$.
4.  **Perform the scalar multiplication:**
    $$ c\vec{v} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ -10 \end{pmatrix} $$
5.  **Check if the resulting vector is in $S$.** The new vector has components $x=-6$ and $y=-10$. Since both are less than 0, this vector is not in the first quadrant and therefore not in the set $S$.
6.  **Conclusion:** The set $S$ is not closed under scalar multiplication, so it cannot be a subspace (and thus not a vector space).

**Answer:** The set **is not a vector space** because it fails closure under scalar multiplication.
</details>

##### **5.3. Centroid of a Triangle**
**Question:** Consider a triangle with vertices $A(-1, 0, 0)$, $B(2, 0, \sqrt{7})$, and $C(3, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{7})$. Find the coordinates of the centroid $G$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Identify the position vectors** for each vertex, which are the same as their coordinates:
    $$ \vec{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \vec{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ \sqrt{7} \end{pmatrix}, \quad \vec{OC} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ \sqrt{7} \end{pmatrix} $$
2.  **Use the formula for the position vector of the centroid, $\vec{OG}$:**
    $$ \vec{OG} = \frac{1}{3}(\vec{OA} + \vec{OB} + \vec{OC}) $$
3.  **Add the vertex vectors:**
    $$ \vec{OA} + \vec{OB} + \vec{OC} = \begin{pmatrix} -1+2+3 \\ 0+0+\sqrt{2} \\ 0+\sqrt{7}+\sqrt{7} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 2\sqrt{7} \end{pmatrix} $$
4.  **Multiply by $\frac{1}{3}$ to get the final coordinates:**
    $$ \vec{OG} = \frac{1}{3} \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 2\sqrt{7} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4/3 \\ \sqrt{2}/3 \\ 2\sqrt{7}/3 \end{pmatrix} $$

**Answer:** The centroid is at **$(4/3, \sqrt{2}/3, 2\sqrt{7}/3)$**.
</details>

##### **5.4. Checking for a Basis**
**Question:** Determine if the set of vectors $B = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \right\}$ forms a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **A set is a basis if it is linearly independent and spans the space.** For $\mathbb{R}^3$, we need 3 vectors that satisfy these conditions.
2.  **Check for linear independence:** Set up the equation $c_1\vec{v}_1 + c_2\vec{v}_2 + c_3\vec{v}_3 = \vec{0}$.
    $$ c_1\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + c_2\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + c_3\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} $$
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\ 2c_2 \\ 3c_3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} $$
    This clearly implies that $c_1 = 0$, $2c_2 = 0 \implies c_2 = 0$, and $3c_3 = 0 \implies c_3 = 0$. Since the only solution is the trivial solution ($c_1=c_2=c_3=0$), the vectors are linearly independent.
3.  **Check if the vectors span $\mathbb{R}^3$:** Since we have 3 linearly independent vectors in a 3-dimensional space, they automatically form a basis and span the space. Any vector $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}$ can be written as a linear combination:
    $$ x\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \frac{y}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \frac{z}{3}\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} $$
    Since any vector can be formed, the set spans $\mathbb{R}^3$.

**Answer:** Yes, the set **is a basis** for $\mathbb{R}^3$.
</details>

##### **5.5. Linear Dependence**
**Question:** Determine if the vectors $\vec{u} = (1, 2)$ and $\vec{v} = (3, 6)$ are linearly dependent.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Check if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other.** For two vectors, this is the easiest way to check for linear dependence.
2.  **Set up the equation $\vec{v} = c\vec{u}$:**
    $$ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = c \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} $$
3.  **Solve for c from the components:**
    *   From the first component: $3 = c \cdot 1 \implies c = 3$.
    *   From the second component: $6 = c \cdot 2 \implies c = 3$.
4.  **Conclusion:** Since we found a consistent scalar $c=3$ such that $\vec{v} = 3\vec{u}$, the vectors are scalar multiples of each other.

**Answer:** The vectors are **linearly dependent**.
</details>

##### **5.6. Vector Projection**
**Question:** Given $\vec{a} = (2, 2, -1)$ and $\vec{b} = (0, 4, 3)$, compute the projection of $\vec{a}$ onto $\vec{b}$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Calculate the dot product $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}$:**
    $$ \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = (2)(0) + (2)(4) + (-1)(3) = 0 + 8 - 3 = 5 $$
2.  **Calculate the squared norm of $\vec{b}$:**
    $$ ||\vec{b}||^2 = 0^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 = 0 + 16 + 9 = 25 $$
3.  **Apply the projection formula:**
    $$ \text{proj}_{\vec{b}}\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{||\vec{b}||^2} \vec{b} = \frac{5}{25} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} $$
4.  **Simplify the result:**
    $$ \text{proj}_{\vec{b}}\vec{a} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 4/5 \\ 3/5 \end{pmatrix} $$

**Answer:** The projection of $\vec{a}$ onto $\vec{b}$ is **$\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 4/5 \\ 3/5 \end{pmatrix}$**.
</details>

##### **5.7. Vector Reflection**
**Question:** Using the vectors from the previous example, compute the reflection of $\vec{a} = (2, 2, -1)$ over the line defined by vector $\vec{b} = (0, 4, 3)$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Recall the projection vector from the previous example:**
    $$ \text{proj}_{\vec{b}}\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 4/5 \\ 3/5 \end{pmatrix} $$
2.  **Apply the reflection formula: $\text{ref}_{\vec{b}}\vec{a} = 2 \cdot \text{proj}_{\vec{b}}\vec{a} - \vec{a}$:**
    $$ \text{ref}_{\vec{b}}\vec{a} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 4/5 \\ 3/5 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} $$
3.  **Perform the scalar multiplication:**
    $$ = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 8/5 \\ 6/5 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} $$
4.  **Perform the vector subtraction:**
    $$ = \begin{pmatrix} 0 - 2 \\ 8/5 - 10/5 \\ 6/5 - (-5/5) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -2/5 \\ 11/5 \end{pmatrix} $$

**Answer:** The reflection of $\vec{a}$ over $\vec{b}$ is **$\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -2/5 \\ 11/5 \end{pmatrix}$**.
</details>
