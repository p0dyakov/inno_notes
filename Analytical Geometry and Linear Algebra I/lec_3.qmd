#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Introduction to Matrices**
A **matrix** is a rectangular grid of numbers or expressions arranged in rows and columns. It serves as a powerful tool for organizing data and representing systems of linear equations or transformations. A matrix is denoted by a capital letter (e.g., $A$), and its individual entries are called **elements**.

The **dimensions** of a matrix are expressed as *m x n*, where *m* is the number of rows and *n* is the number of columns. An element at the intersection of the *i*-th row and *j*-th column is denoted by $a_{ij}$.

For example, a 2x3 matrix A is written as:
$$ A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \end{pmatrix} $$

##### **1.2 Types of Matrices**
Matrices with specific structures and properties are given special names:

*   **Square Matrix**: A matrix where the number of rows equals the number of columns (*m = n*). These are the only matrices that have determinants and inverses.
*   **Identity Matrix ($I$)**: A square matrix with ones on the **main diagonal** (top-left to bottom-right) and zeros everywhere else. It is the matrix equivalent of the number 1; multiplying a matrix by the identity matrix leaves it unchanged ($AI = IA = A$).
*   **Zero Matrix**: A matrix where every element is zero.
*   **Diagonal Matrix**: A square matrix where all elements *not* on the main diagonal are zero.
*   **Symmetric Matrix**: A square matrix that is unchanged by transposition ($A = A^T$). This means that for any *i* and *j*, the element $a_{ij}$ is equal to $a_{ji}$.
*   **Triangular Matrix**: A square matrix where all elements are zero either above or below the main diagonal. If the elements below the diagonal are zero, it is an **upper triangular matrix**. If the elements above are zero, it is a **lower triangular matrix**.
*   **Hermitian Matrix**: An extension of symmetric matrices for complex numbers. A matrix is Hermitian if it is equal to its own **conjugate transpose** (taking the transpose and then the complex conjugate of each element).

##### **1.3 Basic Matrix Operations**
*   **Addition and Subtraction**: These operations are only defined for matrices of the *same dimensions*. The operation is performed *element-wise*, meaning the corresponding elements of the matrices are added or subtracted. For $C = A \pm B$, the elements are $c_{ij} = a_{ij} \pm b_{ij}$.
*   **Scalar Multiplication**: To multiply a matrix by a **scalar** (a single number), you multiply *every element* in the matrix by that scalar. For $B = \lambda A$, the elements are $b_{ij} = \lambda a_{ij}$.
*   **Transpose ($A^T$)**: The **transpose** of a matrix is found by interchanging its rows and columns. The first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on. If A is an *m x n* matrix, $A^T$ is an *n x m* matrix. A key property is that the transpose of a product reverses the order: **$(AB)^T = B^T A^T$**.
*   **Trace ($tr(A)$)**: The **trace** is defined only for a square matrix and is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal. A crucial property is its *cyclic invariance* under multiplication: **$tr(ABC) = tr(BCA) = tr(CAB)$**.

##### **1.4 Matrix Multiplication**
Matrix multiplication is a more complex operation. For the product $AB$ to be defined, the number of columns in matrix A must equal the number of rows in matrix B. If A is an *m x n* matrix and B is an *n x p* matrix, the resulting product C will be an *m x p* matrix.

The element $c_{ij}$ in the resulting matrix is the **dot product** of the *i*-th row of A and the *j*-th column of B.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
There are two key ways to conceptualize matrix-vector multiplication ($Ax$):

1.  **Dot Product View**: Each element of the resulting vector is the dot product of a corresponding row of matrix A with the vector x.
2.  **Linear Combination View**: The resulting vector is a weighted sum (a **linear combination**) of the columns of matrix A, where the weights are the elements of vector x.

A fundamental property of matrix multiplication is that it is *not commutative*: in general, **$AB \neq BA$**. The order matters greatly. Think of it like real-world actions: putting on socks then shoes is very different from putting on shoes then socks. However, matrix multiplication is **associative** ($(AB)C = A(BC)$) and **distributive** ($A(B+C) = AB + AC$).

##### **1.5 The Determinant of a Matrix**
The **determinant**, denoted $det(A)$ or $|A|$, is a unique scalar value that can only be calculated from a **square matrix**. It provides crucial information:

*   **Invertibility**: A matrix has an inverse *if and only if* its determinant is non-zero. A matrix with a zero determinant is called a **singular matrix**.
*   **Geometric Meaning**: The determinant represents the scaling factor of the linear transformation described by the matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, its absolute value tells you how much area is scaled. For a 3x3 matrix, it's the scaling factor for volume. A negative determinant indicates that the transformation also involves a reflection (an "inversion" of orientation).

Key properties of determinants include:

*   $det(AB) = det(A)det(B)$
*   $det(A^T) = det(A)$
*   $det(A^{-1}) = 1 / det(A)$
*   For an *n x n* matrix, $det(kA) = k^n det(A)$

##### **1.6 The Matrix Inverse**
The **inverse** of a square matrix A, written as $A^{-1}$, is the matrix that "undoes" the operation of A. When multiplied together, they yield the identity matrix: $AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I$. This is analogous to how a number multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1 (e.g., $5 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1$). An inverse exists only if the matrix is *non-singular* ($det(A) ≠ 0$).

The **adjugate method** is a common way to find the inverse of a 3x3 matrix:

1.  **Matrix of Minors ($M$)**: For each element $a_{ij}$, its **minor** $M_{ij}$ is the determinant of the 2x2 sub-matrix that remains after deleting the *i*-th row and *j*-th column.
2.  **Matrix of Cofactors ($C$)**: The **cofactor** $C_{ij}$ is the minor with a sign applied, determined by a "checkerboard" pattern. The formula is $C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j}M_{ij}$.
3.  **Adjugate Matrix ($adj(A)$)**: This is the **transpose** of the cofactor matrix, $adj(A)$ = $C^T$.
4.  **Calculate Inverse**: The inverse is found by multiplying the adjugate matrix by the reciprocal of the determinant: $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}\text{adj}(A)$.

##### **1.7 The Vector Cross Product**
The **cross product** is an operation between two vectors in 3D space, written as **a x b**. The result is a new vector that is geometrically *perpendicular* (orthogonal) to both of the original vectors.

The direction of the resulting vector is given by the **right-hand rule**: point the fingers of your right hand in the direction of vector **a**, then curl them toward vector **b**. Your thumb will point in the direction of **a x b**.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
Key properties of the cross product:

*   *Anti-commutative*: Reversing the order flips the direction of the resulting vector: **a x b = - (b x a)**.
*   *Parallel Vectors*: The cross product of two parallel vectors is the zero vector (**0**).
*   *Magnitude*: The magnitude, $|| \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} ||$, equals the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors **a** and **b**. The area of the triangle with these sides is half this value.

##### **1.8 Triple Products**
Triple products combine dot and cross products for three vectors.

*   **Scalar Triple Product**: This product, $\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})$, results in a **scalar**. Its absolute value represents the **volume of the parallelepiped** with sides **a**, **b**, and **c**. If the result is 0, the vectors are **coplanar** (they all lie in the same plane), meaning the parallelepiped is flat and has no volume. The operation is cyclically symmetric: $\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{c} \cdot (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})$.
<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
*   **Vector Triple Product**: This product, $\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})$, results in a **vector**. The resulting vector lies in the same plane as **b** and **c**. It can be simplified with the **"BAC-CAB"** identity: $\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c})\mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}$.

Another key identity is the **Jacobi identity**, which shows a cyclic relationship between triple products:
$$ \mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{c} \times (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{0} $$

    $$ \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \det \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \end{pmatrix} $$
*   **Scalar Triple Product (Determinant Form)**:
    $$ \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = \det \begin{pmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \\ c_1 & c_2 & c_3 \end{pmatrix} $$
*   **Vector Triple Product (BAC-CAB)**: $\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c})\mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}$.

*   **Volume of Parallelepiped**: Volume $= |\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})|$.

#### **4. Mistakes**

*   **Assuming Matrix Multiplication is Commutative:** Always remember that $AB$ is generally not equal to $BA$. **Why it's wrong:** The dot product of rows with columns is order-dependent. Swapping the matrices changes which rows are multiplied by which columns, leading to a completely different operation and result.
*   **Incorrectly Applying Determinant Properties:** Assuming that $det(A + B) = det(A) + det(B)$. **Why it's wrong:** The determinant does not distribute over addition. This property simply does not hold true. The multiplicative property $det(AB) = det(A)det(B)$ is valid, but an additive equivalent does not exist.
*   **Forgetting the Sign Pattern in Cofactor Expansion:** When calculating a determinant or a matrix of cofactors, it is easy to forget the $(-1)^{i+j}$ "checkerboard" pattern of signs. **Why it's wrong:** These alternating signs are a fundamental part of the definition of the determinant. Omitting them will almost certainly lead to an incorrect value.
*   **Multiplying Matrices with Incompatible Dimensions:** Trying to multiply an *m x n* matrix by a *p x q* matrix where *n ≠ p*. **Why it's wrong:** Matrix multiplication is defined by the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second. The length of these rows (*n*) must match the length of these columns (*p*) for the dot product to be a valid operation.
*   **Confusing the Adjugate with the Cofactor Matrix:** Using the cofactor matrix directly to find the inverse instead of its transpose (the adjugate). **Why it's wrong:** The formula for the inverse explicitly requires the adjugate, $adj(A)$, which is defined as the transpose of the cofactor matrix ($C^T$). Using C directly will produce an incorrect inverse.
*   **Misremembering the Vector Triple Product Rule:** Switching the terms in the BAC-CAB rule, for example as $(a \cdot b)c - (a \cdot c)b$. **Why it's wrong:** The rule is precise. The positive term is formed by the dot product of the "outer" vectors ($\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{c}$) scaling the "middle" vector ($\mathbf{b}$). Getting the order or signs wrong changes the resulting vector completely.

1.  **Set up the scalar triple product** as the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors. The absolute value of this determinant gives the volume.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Calculate the left side: $\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})$**
    First, find the inner cross product $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}$:
    $$ \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \det \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 3 & 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 & 4 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(0-1) - \mathbf{j}(12 - (-1)) + \mathbf{k}(3-0) = \langle -1, -13, 3 \rangle $$
    Next, find the outer cross product $\mathbf{a} \times (\text{result})$:
    $$ \mathbf{a} \times \langle -1, -13, 3 \rangle = \det \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 0 \\ -1 & -13 & 3 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(6-0) - \mathbf{j}(3-0) + \mathbf{k}(-13 - (-2)) = \langle 6, -3, -11 \rangle $$
2.  **Calculate the right side: $(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c})\mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}$**
    First, find the required dot products:
    $$ \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} = (1)(-1) + (2)(1) + (0)(4) = -1 + 2 = 1 $$
    $$ \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = (1)(3) + (2)(0) + (0)(1) = 3 $$
    Next, use these scalars to weigh the vectors:
    $$ (1)\mathbf{b} - (3)\mathbf{c} = 1\langle 3, 0, 1 \rangle - 3\langle -1, 1, 4 \rangle $$
    $$ = \langle 3, 0, 1 \rangle - \langle -3, 3, 12 \rangle = \langle 3 - (-3), 0 - 3, 1 - 12 \rangle = \langle 6, -3, -11 \rangle $$
3.  **Compare the results:** Both sides evaluate to the same vector, $\langle 6, -3, -11 \rangle$.

**Answer:** The identity is verified, as both sides of the equation result in the vector **$\langle 6, -3, -11 \rangle$**.

##### **5.7. Jacobi Identity**
**Question:** Prove the Jacobi identity $\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{c} \times (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{0}$ for the standard basis vectors $\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{i} = \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle$, $\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{j} = \langle 0, 1, 0 \rangle$, and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{k} = \langle 0, 0, 1 \rangle$.

1.  **Calculate the first term: $\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})$**
    $$ \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{j} \times \mathbf{k} = \mathbf{i} = \mathbf{a} $$
    $$ \mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0} $$
    (The cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector).
2.  **Calculate the second term: $\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a})$**
    $$ \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{i} = \mathbf{j} = \mathbf{b} $$
    $$ \mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{0} $$
3.  **Calculate the third term: $\mathbf{c} \times (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})$**
    $$ \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{i} \times \mathbf{j} = \mathbf{k} = \mathbf{c} $$
    $$ \mathbf{c} \times (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0} $$
4.  **Sum the three resulting vectors:**
    $$ \mathbf{0} + \mathbf{0} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0} $$

**Answer:** The Jacobi identity holds, as the sum is the zero vector, **$\mathbf{0}$**.
