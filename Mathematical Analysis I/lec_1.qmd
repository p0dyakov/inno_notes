#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 What is Real Analysis?**

###### **1.1.1 The Foundation of Calculus**
**Real analysis** is the branch of mathematics that provides the rigorous, theoretical foundation for calculus. While introductory calculus teaches you *how* to use rules like the chain rule or L'Hopital's rule, real analysis explains *why* these rules are true. It builds the entire framework of calculus from a small set of fundamental truths, or **axioms**. The primary goal is to gain a deep understanding of concepts like the *limit*, the *derivative*, and the *integral*.

###### **1.1.2 The Dangers of Applying Rules Blindly**
To study mathematics effectively, one must know not just *what* is true, but *why* it is true. Applying familiar algebraic rules without understanding their underlying principles and limitations can lead to logical disasters.

*   **Example 1: Hidden Division by Zero:** In the equation $x(x+1) = x^2$, one might be tempted to cancel an *x* from both sides to get $x+1 = x$, which implies the absurdity $1=0$. The error is canceling *x* without first checking if it is zero.
*   **Example 2: Invalid Operations on Infinite Sequences:** An incorrect manipulation of limits can "prove" that the sequence $1, 2, 4, 8, ...$ converges to zero. The operations used in the faulty proof are only valid if the limit exists in the first place, which it does not for this sequence.
*   **Example 3: Manipulating Infinite Series:** The same algebraic trick can be used to show that $1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... = 2$ (which is correct) and that $1 + 2 + 4 + ... = -1$ (which is nonsensical). This demonstrates that rules for finite sums do not automatically apply to infinite series.

##### **1.2 Essential Tools: Logic and Set Theory**

###### **1.2.1 Logical Symbols and Statements**
Analysis relies on precise language. A **statement** is something that is either true or false, but not both.

*   **Conjunction ($\land$)**: Read as "and".
*   **Disjunction ($\lor$)**: Read as "or".
*   **Implication ($\Rightarrow$)**: "A implies B" or "If A, then B".
*   **Equivalence ($\Leftrightarrow$)**: "A if and only if B".
*   **Quantifiers**: `∀` reads as "for all". `∃` reads as "there exists".

###### **1.2.2 Fundamentals of Set Theory**
A **set** is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, called **elements**.

*   **Empty Set ($\emptyset$)**: The set containing no elements.
*   **Subset ($\subseteq$)**: A set *A* is a subset of *B* if every element of *A* is also in *B*.
*   **Union ($\cup$)**: $A \cup B$ is the set of all elements in *A*, or in *B*, or in both.
*   **Intersection ($\cap$)**: $A \cap B$ is the set containing only elements common to both *A* and *B*.
*   **Complement ($A^c$)**: Relative to a **universal set** *U*, the complement of *A* is the set of all elements in *U* that are not in *A*.
*   **De Morgan's Laws**: $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$ and $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$.

##### **1.3 The Real Number System ($\mathbb{R}$)**

###### **1.3.1 The Axiomatic Foundation**
The **real numbers** ($\mathbb{R}$) are defined rigorously by a set of axioms.

*   **Field Axioms (Algebraic)**: These define standard arithmetic (commutativity, associativity, identities, inverses, distributivity).
*   **Order Axioms**: These establish the properties of inequality (`<`, `>`), ensuring that any two real numbers can be compared.
*   **Completeness Axiom**: This is the key axiom that ensures there are no "holes" on the number line. Its most common form is the **Least Upper Bound Property**: *every non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound (a supremum)*.

###### **1.3.2 Properties and Consequences of the Axioms**
*   **Absolute Value**: The absolute value of *x*, denoted $|x|$, is its distance from zero. Its most important property is the **Triangle Inequality**: $|x + y| \le |x| + |y|$.
*   **Archimedean Property**: A consequence of completeness, this states that for any real number *x*, there exists a natural number *n* such that $n > x$.
*   **Density**: Both the rational numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$) and the irrational numbers are **dense** in the real number line, meaning between any two real numbers, you can always find one of each.

##### **1.4 Sizing Infinity: Cardinality and the Continuum**

###### **1.4.1 Countable vs. Uncountable Sets**
*   **Countable Set**: An infinite set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers ($\mathbb{N}$). The rational numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$) are a key example of a countable set.
*   **Uncountable Set**: An infinite set that is too large to be put into a one-to-one correspondence with $\mathbb{N}$.

###### **1.4.2 The Continuum**
The set of real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) is **uncountable**, a fact proven by Cantor's diagonalization argument. An infinite set that has the same cardinality (size) as the real numbers is said to have the cardinality of the **continuum**. This reveals that there are different, distinct sizes of infinity.

##### **1.5 Introduction to Complex Numbers**
A **complex number** extends the real number system by introducing the **imaginary unit**, $i$, defined by $i^2 = -1$.
$$ z = a + bi $$

*   $a$ is the **real part** and $b$ is the **imaginary part**.
*   Complex numbers are visualized on a two-dimensional **complex plane** (or Argand plane).

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.5.1 Geometric Properties**
*   **Modulus ($|z|$):** The distance from the origin to the point $(a, b)$. Calculated as $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
*   **Argument ($\theta$):** The angle the line from the origin to $(a, b)$ makes with the positive real axis.
*   The equation $|z - c| = r$ represents a **circle** of radius *r* centered at the complex number *c*. This leads to several important geometric sets:
    *   $|z - c| \le r$ describes a **closed disk** (the circle and its interior).
    *   $|z - c| < r$ describes an **open disk** (the interior of the circle only).
    *   $|z - c| \ge r$ describes the **exterior of a disk**, including its boundary.

###### **1.5.2 Trigonometric and Exponential Forms**
Using the modulus *r* and argument $\theta$, a complex number can be expressed in two other crucial forms:

1.  **Trigonometric Form:** $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$
2.  **Exponential (Polar) Form:** Using **Euler's Formula**, $e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$, we get the compact form $z = re^{i\theta}$.

##### **1.6 De Moivre's Theorem**
This theorem provides a straightforward way to calculate powers and roots of complex numbers.

*   **Powers:** For any integer *n*, the *n*-th power of a complex number is:
    $$ z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta)) $$
*   **Roots:** A complex number has exactly *n* distinct *n*-th roots, given by:
    $$ \sqrt[n]{z} = \sqrt[n]{r} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right) $$
    for $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$.

##### **1.7 The Principle of Mathematical Induction**

###### **1.7.1 A Tool for Deductive Proof**
**Mathematical induction** is a rigorous proof technique used to establish that a statement holds for all natural numbers. It is a deductive method and should not be confused with inductive reasoning (generalizing from patterns).

###### **1.7.2 The Domino Effect: Base Case and Inductive Step**
A proof by induction requires two parts:

1.  **Base Case**: Prove the statement is true for the first value (e.g., $n=1$).
2.  **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement is true for an arbitrary integer $k$ (the **Inductive Hypothesis**), and use this assumption to prove the statement is also true for $k+1$.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.7.3 A Cautionary Tale: Moser's Circle Problem**
The danger of relying on patterns is shown by Moser's circle problem. If you place *n* points on a circle and connect them, the number of regions appears to be $2^{n-1}$ for $n=1, ..., 5$. However, this pattern fails at $n=6$. This illustrates why a rigorous proof like induction is essential.

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Set**: A well-defined collection of distinct objects.
*   **Subset**: A set *A* is a subset of *B* if all elements of *A* are also elements of *B*.
*   **Countable Set**: An infinite set whose elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.
*   **Uncountable Set**: An infinite set that is not countable (e.g., the real numbers).
*   **Continuum**: The cardinality (size) of the set of real numbers.
*   **Supremum (sup)**: The least upper bound of a set of real numbers.
*   **Infimum (inf)**: The greatest lower bound of a set of real numbers.
*   **Complex Number**: A number of the form $a + bi$, where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $i = \sqrt{-1}$.
*   **Complex Plane**: A two-dimensional plane for representing complex numbers.
*   **Modulus ($|z|$)**: The magnitude of a complex number; its distance from the origin.
*   **Argument ($\theta$)**: The angle of a complex number's vector on the complex plane.
*   **Euler's Formula**: The identity $e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$.
*   **De Moivre's Theorem**: A formula for computing powers and roots of complex numbers.
*   **Mathematical Induction**: A proof technique used to establish the truth of a statement for all natural numbers.

#### **3. Formulas**

*   **De Morgan's Laws**: $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$ and $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$
*   **Triangle Inequality**: $|x + y| \le |x| + |y|$
*   **Bernoulli's Inequality**: For $x > -1$ and integer $n \ge 1$, $(1+x)^n \ge 1+nx$.
*   **Modulus of a Complex Number**: $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
*   **Trigonometric Form**: $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$
*   **Euler's Formula**: $e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$
*   **Exponential (Polar) Form**: $z = re^{i\theta}$
*   **De Moivre's Theorem (Powers)**: $z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))$
*   **De Moivre's Theorem (Roots)**: $\sqrt[n]{z} = \sqrt[n]{r} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right)$ for $k = 0, \dots, n-1$

#### **4. Mistakes**

*   **Confusing Inductive Reasoning with Mathematical Induction**: Observing a pattern for a few cases (e.g., Moser's circle problem) and concluding it holds for all cases. **Why it's wrong**: Patterns can break. Mathematical induction is a rigorous proof that establishes a logical link between successive cases.
*   **Applying Familiar Rules Blindly**: Manipulating infinite series as if they were finite sums or cancelling terms without checking for division by zero. **Why it's wrong**: The rules of finite arithmetic do not always apply to infinite processes and require rigorous justification from analysis.
*   **Forgetting the Quadrant for the Argument**: Using $\theta = \tan^{-1}(b/a)$ without checking the signs of *a* and *b*. **Why it's wrong**: The arctan function has a limited range. You must adjust the angle to place it in the correct quadrant, otherwise all subsequent calculations will be incorrect.
*   **Finding Only One n-th Root**: When asked for the roots of a complex number, only calculating the principal root (for $k=0$). **Why it's wrong**: A complex number has exactly *n* distinct *n*-th roots. You must iterate through $k = 0, 1, \dots, n-1$.
*   **Skipping the Base Case in Induction**: Starting an induction proof with the inductive hypothesis without first proving the statement is true for the initial value. **Why it's wrong**: The entire logical chain depends on the first "domino" falling. Without a valid base case, the proof is meaningless.
*   **Assuming P(k+1) is True in the Inductive Step**: Starting the inductive step by writing down the statement for $k+1$. **Why it's wrong**: This is circular reasoning. The correct method is to start with the assumption for *k* and logically *derive* the statement for $k+1$.

#### **5. Examples**

##### **5.1. Irrationality Proof**
**Question:** Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **Assume the opposite:** Assume $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, so $\sqrt{2} = p/q$ where $p, q$ are integers with no common factors.
2.  **Square both sides:** $2 = p^2/q^2 \implies p^2 = 2q^2$.
3.  **Deduce properties of p:** $p^2$ is even, so *p* must be even. Let $p = 2k$.
4.  **Substitute and deduce properties of q:** $(2k)^2 = 2q^2 \implies 4k^2 = 2q^2 \implies q^2 = 2k^2$. So $q^2$ is even, which means *q* is even.
5.  **Contradiction:** Both *p* and *q* are even, contradicting that they have no common factors.
**Answer:** Therefore, **$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational**.

##### **5.2. Finding Supremum and Infimum**
**Question:** Find the supremum and infimum of the set $E = \{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **List elements:** The set is $\{1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, ...\}$.
2.  **Find bounds:** The largest element is 1. As *n* grows, the elements approach 0 but never reach it.
3.  **Identify sup and inf:** The least upper bound is 1. The greatest lower bound is 0.
4.  **Check for max/min:** The supremum (1) is in the set, so it is a maximum. The infimum (0) is not in the set, so there is no minimum.
**Answer:** **$\sup(E) = 1$, $\inf(E) = 0$.**
</details>

##### **5.3. Complex Number Division**
**Question:** Find the values of $P$ and $Q$ if $P+Qi = \frac{3-i}{1+i}$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **Multiply by the complex conjugate** of the denominator, which is $1-i$.
    $$ \frac{3-i}{1+i} \times \frac{1-i}{1-i} = \frac{3 - 3i - i + i^2}{1^2 - i^2} $$
2.  **Simplify:**
    $$ \frac{3 - 4i - 1}{1 - (-1)} = \frac{2 - 4i}{2} = 1 - 2i $$
3.  **Identify P and Q:** Comparing $1-2i$ with $P+Qi$, we find $P=1$ and $Q=-2$.
**Answer:** **$P=1$, $Q=-2$**.
</details>

##### **5.4. Powers of Complex Numbers**
**Question:** Compute $(1 - i)^{8}$ using De Moivre's Theorem.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **Convert to trigonometric form:** For $z = 1-i$, the modulus is $r = \sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{2}$. The argument is $\theta = 7\pi/4$ (or $-\pi/4$). So $z = \sqrt{2}(\cos(7\pi/4) + i\sin(7\pi/4))$.
2.  **Apply De Moivre's Theorem with $n=8$:**
    $$ z^8 = (\sqrt{2})^8 \left( \cos\left(8 \cdot \frac{7\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(8 \cdot \frac{7\pi}{4}\right) \right) $$
3.  **Simplify:**
    $$ z^8 = 16 ( \cos(14\pi) + i\sin(14\pi) ) = 16(1 + i \cdot 0) = 16 $$
**Answer:** **16**.
</details>

##### **5.5. Roots of Complex Numbers**
**Question:** Find the three cube roots of $z = -8i$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **Convert to trigonometric form:** For $z=-8i$, $r=8$ and $\theta=3\pi/2$.
2.  **Apply the n-th root formula** with $n=3$, $k=0, 1, 2$:
    $$ w_k = \sqrt[3]{8} \left( \cos\left(\frac{3\pi/2 + 2k\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{3\pi/2 + 2k\pi}{3}\right) \right) $$
3.  **Calculate for $k=0$:** $w_0 = 2(\cos(\pi/2) + i\sin(\pi/2)) = 2i$.
4.  **Calculate for $k=1$:** $w_1 = 2(\cos(7\pi/6) + i\sin(7\pi/6)) = -\sqrt{3} - i$.
5.  **Calculate for $k=2$:** $w_2 = 2(\cos(11\pi/6) + i\sin(11\pi/6)) = \sqrt{3} - i$.
**Answer:** The three cube roots are **$2i$, $-\sqrt{3} - i$, and $\sqrt{3} - i$**.
</details>

##### **5.6. Geometric Set Description**
**Question:** Describe the set of points in the complex plane satisfying $1 \le |z + 2| < 3$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **Interpret the expression:** $|z+2|$ is $|z - (-2)|$, the distance from $z$ to the point $-2$.
2.  **Interpret the inequalities:** The distance must be greater than or equal to 1, and less than 3.
3.  **Combine:** This describes an **annulus** (a ring) centered at $-2$, with an inner radius of 1 (inclusive) and an outer radius of 3 (exclusive).
**Answer:** The set is an **annulus centered at $-2+0i$**, including the inner circle of radius 1 and excluding the outer circle of radius 3.
</details>

##### **5.7. Induction with Divisibility**
**Question:** Prove that $4^n - 1$ is divisible by 3 for all integers $n \ge 1$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
1.  **Base Case ($n=1$):** $4^1 - 1 = 3$, which is divisible by 3. True.
2.  **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume for some integer $k \ge 1$, $4^k - 1 = 3m$ for some integer $m$.
3.  **Inductive Step:** We must prove $4^{k+1} - 1$ is divisible by 3.
    $$ 4^{k+1} - 1 = 4 \cdot 4^k - 1 $$
    From the hypothesis, $4^k = 3m + 1$. Substitute this in.
    $$ 4(3m + 1) - 1 = 12m + 4 - 1 = 12m + 3 = 3(4m + 1) $$
    This is a multiple of 3.
**Answer:** By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all integers $n \ge 1$.
