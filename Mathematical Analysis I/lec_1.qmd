#### 1. Summary

This guide provides a foundational overview of three key topics in mathematical analysis: basic set theory, complex numbers, and the principle of mathematical induction. We will explore the definitions, properties, and applications of each, establishing the groundwork for more advanced mathematical concepts.

##### 1.1 Basics of Set Theory

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects, known as **elements** or **members**. The language of sets is fundamental to modern mathematics.

*   **Notation**: Sets are typically denoted by capital letters (e.g., $A$, $B$, $X$), and their elements are listed within curly braces `{}`. For example, the set $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ contains the elements 1, 2, and 3.
*   **Set-Builder Notation**: A set can also be defined by a property that its elements must satisfy. The notation $A = \{x \in X \mid p(x)\}$ defines a set $A$ that contains all elements $x$ from a larger set $X$ for which the property $p(x)$ is true.
*   **Subsets**: If every element of a set $A$ is also an element of a set $X$, then $A$ is a **subset** of $X$, denoted as $A \subseteq X$. If $A$ is a subset of $X$ but is not equal to $X$, it is a **proper subset**, denoted $A \subset X$.
*   **Power Set**: The **power set** of a set $X$, denoted $\mathcal{P}(X)$, is the set of *all possible subsets* of $X$. If $X$ has $n$ elements, its power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ has $2^n$ elements.
*   **Set Operations**:
    *   **Union ($A \cup B$)**: The set of all elements that are in set $A$, or in set $B$, or in both.
    *   **Intersection ($A \cap B$)**: The set of all elements that are in *both* set $A$ and set $B$.
    *   **Complement ($A^c$ or $A'$)**: The set of all elements in the universal set $X$ that are *not* in set $A$.

##### 1.2 Complex Numbers

Complex numbers extend the concept of one-dimensional real numbers to a two-dimensional plane. They are essential in many fields of science and engineering.

*   **Definition**: A **complex number**, $z$, is a number of the form $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the **imaginary unit**, defined by the property $i^2 = -1$.
    *   $a$ is called the **real part**, denoted $\text{Re}(z)$.
    *   $b$ is called the **imaginary part**, denoted $\text{Im}(z)$.
*   **Geometric Representation**: Every complex number $z = a + bi$ can be visualized as a point $(a, b)$ in a two-dimensional Cartesian plane called the **complex plane** or **Argand plane**. The horizontal axis is the *real axis*, and the vertical axis is the *imaginary axis*.

\end{tikzpicture}
````
*   **Trigonometric and Exponential Forms**: A complex number can also be represented using polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$.
    *   The distance $r$ from the origin is the **modulus** or **absolute value**, given by $r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
    *   The angle $\theta$ from the positive real axis is the **argument**, given by $\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$, adjusted for the correct quadrant.
    *   This leads to the **trigonometric form**: $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$.
    *   Using **Euler's Formula**, $e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$, we get the **exponential (or polar) form**: $z = re^{i\theta}$.
*   **De Moivre's Theorem**: For any integer $n$, this theorem provides a formula for calculating powers of complex numbers:
    $$ z^n = [r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)]^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta)) $$

##### 1.3 Principles of Mathematical Induction

**Mathematical induction** is a powerful proof technique used to prove that a statement, formula, or property $P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers $n$ (or all integers from a certain starting point). It is analogous to a chain of dominoes falling.

The proof consists of three logical steps:

1.  **Base Case**: Prove that the statement $P(n)$ is true for the first possible value of $n$ (usually $n=1$). *This is like tipping the first domino.*
2.  **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that the statement $P(k)$ is true for some arbitrary natural number $k$. *This is the assumption that if any given domino falls...*
3.  **Inductive Step**: Using the inductive hypothesis, prove that the statement $P(k+1)$ must also be true. *...then the next domino in the line will also fall.*

Once these three steps are successfully completed, we can conclude that the statement $P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers $n \ge 1$.

#### 2. Definitions

*   **Set**: A well-defined collection of distinct objects.
*   **Subset**: A set $A$ is a subset of $B$ if all elements of $A$ are also elements of $B$.
*   **Power Set**: The set of all subsets of a given set.
*   **Union**: The set of elements present in either of two sets.
*   **Intersection**: The set of elements common to two sets.
*   **Complement**: The set of elements not in a given set, relative to a universal set.
*   **Complex Number**: A number of the form $a+bi$, where $a, b$ are real numbers and $i = \sqrt{-1}$.
*   **Imaginary Unit ($i$)**: The number defined by the property $i^2 = -1$.
*   **Complex Plane (Argand Plane)**: The two-dimensional plane where complex numbers are represented geometrically.
*   **Mathematical Induction**: A method of mathematical proof used to establish that a given statement is true for all natural numbers.

#### 3. Formulas

*   **Cardinality of Power Set**: For a set $X$ with $n$ elements, $|\mathcal{P}(X)| = 2^n$.
*   **Union**: $A \cup B = \{x \mid x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}$.
*   **Intersection**: $A \cap B = \{x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}$.
*   **Complex Number Standard Form**: $z = a + bi$.
*   **Imaginary Unit**: $i = \sqrt{-1}$.
*   **Modulus of a Complex Number**: $r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
*   **Argument of a Complex Number**: $\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$.
*   **Trigonometric Form**: $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$.
*   **Euler's Formula**: $e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$.
*   **Exponential (Polar) Form**: $z = re^{i\theta}$.
*   **De Moivre's Theorem**: $z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))$.

#### 4. Mistakes

*   **Confusing the Imaginary Part with the Imaginary Term**: The imaginary part of $a+bi$ is the real number $b$, not $bi$.
    **Why it's wrong**: The imaginary part is a real-valued coefficient of the imaginary unit $i$.
*   **Forgetting the Base Case in Induction**: Starting an induction proof with the inductive hypothesis without first proving the statement for the initial value (e.g., $n=1$).
    **Why it's wrong**: The inductive step only proves that *if* one domino falls, the next one does. The base case proves that the first domino actually falls, starting the chain reaction. Without it, the entire proof is invalid.
*   **Incorrectly Applying De Moivre's Theorem**: When calculating $(r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta))^n$, a common mistake is to forget to raise the modulus $r$ to the power of $n$, resulting in $r(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))$.
    **Why it's wrong**: The theorem requires both the modulus to be raised to the power and the argument to be multiplied by it.
*   **Circular Reasoning in the Inductive Step**: Assuming $P(k+1)$ is true to prove that $P(k+1)$ is true. You must only use the assumption that $P(k)$ is true.
    **Why it's wrong**: This is a logical fallacy. The goal is to show that $P(k)$ *implies* $P(k+1)$, not that $P(k+1)$ implies itself.
*   **Mistaking Subset for Element**: Confusing the relationships "is an element of" ($\in$) and "is a subset of" ($\subseteq$). For example, for the set $A = \{1, 2\}$, the number $1$ is an element ($1 \in A$), but the set $\{1\}$ is a subset ($\{1\} \subseteq A$).
    **Why it's wrong**: Sets contain elements, but they can also contain other sets as elements. The distinction is crucial for operations like the power set.

#### 5. Examples

##### Example 1: Simplifying Complex Numbers
**Question**: Express $(2+3i)^2$ in the form $X+Yi$.

1.  **Expand the expression** using the formula $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.
    $$ (2+3i)^2 = (2)^2 + 2(2)(3i) + (3i)^2 $$
2.  **Simplify each term**.
    $$ = 4 + 12i + 9i^2 $$
3.  **Substitute $i^2 = -1$**.
    $$ = 4 + 12i + 9(-1) $$
    $$ = 4 + 12i - 9 $$
4.  **Combine the real parts**.
    $$ = (4-9) + 12i = -5 + 12i $$

**Answer**: **$-5 + 12i$**

##### Example 2: Complex Number Division
**Question**: Express $\frac{3-4i}{5+2i}$ in the form $X+Yi$.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find the conjugate** of the denominator. The conjugate of $5+2i$ is $5-2i$.
2.  **Multiply the numerator and denominator** by the conjugate.
    $$ \frac{3-4i}{5+2i} \times \frac{5-2i}{5-2i} = \frac{(3-4i)(5-2i)}{(5+2i)(5-2i)} $$
3.  **Expand the numerator**: $(3)(5) + (3)(-2i) + (-4i)(5) + (-4i)(-2i) = 15 - 6i - 20i + 8i^2$.
4.  **Expand the denominator**: $(5)^2 - (2i)^2 = 25 - 4i^2$.
5.  **Substitute $i^2 = -1$** in both numerator and denominator and simplify.
    *   Numerator: $15 - 26i + 8(-1) = 15 - 26i - 8 = 7 - 26i$.
    *   Denominator: $25 - 4(-1) = 25 + 4 = 29$.
6.  **Write the final fraction**.
    $$ \frac{7 - 26i}{29} = \frac{7}{29} - \frac{26}{29}i $$

**Answer**: **$\frac{7}{29} - \frac{26}{29}i$**

##### Example 3: Finding Trigonometric and Exponential Forms
**Question**: Write the complex number $Z = 1+i$ in trigonometric and exponential forms.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Identify the real and imaginary parts**: $a=1$ and $b=1$.
2.  **Calculate the modulus ($r$)**:
    $$ r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2} $$
3.  **Calculate the argument ($\theta$)**:
    $$ \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{1}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4} \text{ radians (or 45°)} $$
    *(Since a and b are both positive, the point is in the first quadrant, so the angle is correct.)*
4.  **Write the trigonometric form** $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$.
    $$ Z = \sqrt{2}\left(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right) $$
5.  **Write the exponential form** $z = re^{i\theta}$.
    $$ Z = \sqrt{2}e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} $$

**Answer**:
*   Trigonometric: **$\sqrt{2}\left(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right)$**
*   Exponential: **$\sqrt{2}e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$**
</details>

##### Example 4: Using De Moivre's Theorem
**Question**: Simplify $Z = (2+2i)^3$ using De Moivre's Theorem.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Convert the base ($2+2i$) to trigonometric form**.
    *   $a=2$, $b=2$.
    *   Modulus $r = \sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{4+4} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}$.
    *   Argument $\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{2}{2}\right) = \arctan(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}$.
    *   So, $2+2i = 2\sqrt{2}\left(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right)$.
2.  **Apply De Moivre's Theorem**, with $n=3$.
    $$ Z = \left(2\sqrt{2}\right)^3\left(\cos\left(3 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(3 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right) $$
3.  **Simplify the modulus and the argument**.
    *   $(2\sqrt{2})^3 = 2^3 \cdot (\sqrt{2})^3 = 8 \cdot 2\sqrt{2} = 16\sqrt{2}$.
    *   $3 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{4}$.
    *   $Z = 16\sqrt{2}\left(\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)\right)$.
4.  **Convert back to standard form** $X+Yi$.
    *   $\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
    *   $\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
    *   $Z = 16\sqrt{2}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = 16\left(-\frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2}\right) = 16(-1+i)$.

**Answer**: **$-16 + 16i$**

##### Example 5: Proof by Mathematical Induction
**Question**: Using the principles of mathematical induction, show that for all positive integer values of $n$, $P(n) = 5^{2n} + 3n - 1$ is an integer multiple of 9.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Base Case**: Test for $n=1$.
    $$ P(1) = 5^{2(1)} + 3(1) - 1 = 25 + 3 - 1 = 27 $$
    Since $27 = 9 \times 3$, the statement is true for $n=1$.
2.  **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer $k$. That is, assume $5^{2k} + 3k - 1$ is a multiple of 9.
    This means we can write $5^{2k} + 3k - 1 = 9m$ for some integer $m$.
    From this, we can state: $5^{2k} = 9m - 3k + 1$.
3.  **Inductive Step**: Prove the statement is true for $n=k+1$. We need to show that $P(k+1) = 5^{2(k+1)} + 3(k+1) - 1$ is a multiple of 9.
    $$ 5^{2(k+1)} + 3(k+1) - 1 = 5^{2k+2} + 3k + 3 - 1 $$
    $$ = 5^2 \cdot 5^{2k} + 3k + 2 $$
    $$ = 25 \cdot 5^{2k} + 3k + 2 $$
    Now, substitute the expression for $5^{2k}$ from our hypothesis:
    $$ = 25(9m - 3k + 1) + 3k + 2 $$
    $$ = 225m - 75k + 25 + 3k + 2 $$
    $$ = 225m - 72k + 27 $$
    Factor out 9 from the expression:
    $$ = 9(25m - 8k + 3) $$
    Since $m$ and $k$ are integers, $(25m - 8k + 3)$ is also an integer. Therefore, $P(k+1)$ is a multiple of 9.

**Answer**: Since the base case is true and the inductive step holds, by the principle of mathematical induction, **$5^{2n} + 3n - 1$ is a multiple of 9 for all positive integers $n$**.
