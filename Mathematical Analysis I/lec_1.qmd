#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Set Theory Fundamentals**
A **set** is a collection of distinct objects, referred to as **elements** or **members**. The fundamental idea is that a set is defined purely by the elements it contains, not by the order in which they are listed.

Sets of numbers are foundational in mathematics:
*   **Natural Numbers ($\mathbb{N}$):** The set of positive counting numbers, $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$.
*   **Integers ($\mathbb{Z}$):** The set of all whole numbers, including positive, negative, and zero, $\{\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots\}$.
*   **Rational Numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$):** Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$.
*   **Irrational Numbers ($\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$):** Numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction, like $\pi$ or $\sqrt{2}$.
*   **Real Numbers ($\mathbb{R}$):** The set combining both rational and irrational numbers.
*   **Complex Numbers ($\mathbb{C}$):** Numbers that extend the real number line, which will be discussed in detail.

There are several key concepts and operations related to sets:
*   **Subset:** A set $A$ is a *subset* of set $X$ (denoted $A \subseteq X$) if every element of $A$ is also an element of $X$. If $A$ is a subset but is not equal to $X$, it is a *proper subset* ($A \subset X$).
*   **Power Set ($\mathcal{P}(X)$):** The set of all possible subsets of a given set $X$. If $X$ has $n$ elements, its power set will have $2^n$ elements.
*   **Union ($A \cup B$):** The set containing all elements that are in set $A$, or in set $B$, or in both.
*   **Intersection ($A \cap B$):** The set containing only the elements that are common to both set $A$ and set $B$.
*   **Complement ($A^c$):** The set of all elements in the universal set $X$ that are not in set $A$.

##### **1.2 Introduction to Complex Numbers**
A **complex number** is an extension of the real number system that allows for the square root of negative numbers. It is written in the standard form:
$$ z = a + bi $$
where:
*   $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.
*   $a$ is the **real part** of the complex number, denoted as $\text{Re}(z)$.
*   $b$ is the **imaginary part**, denoted as $\text{Im}(z)$.
*   $i$ is the **imaginary unit**, defined by the property $i^2 = -1$, or $i = \sqrt{-1}$.

For example, in the complex number $3 + 4i$, the real part is 3, and the imaginary part is 4.

##### **1.3 Geometric Representation of Complex Numbers**
Complex numbers can be visualized as points or vectors on a two-dimensional plane called the **complex plane** or **Argand plane**.
*   The horizontal axis represents the **real part** ($a$).
*   The vertical axis represents the **imaginary part** ($b$).

A complex number $z = a + bi$ corresponds to the point $(a, b)$ on this plane. This geometric view allows us to define two important properties:
*   **Modulus ($r$):** The distance of the point $(a, b)$ from the origin. It is also known as the absolute value of the complex number, $|z|$. It is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: $r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
*   **Argument ($\theta$):** The angle that the line connecting the origin to the point $(a, b)$ makes with the positive real axis. It is calculated as $\theta = \tan^{-1}(b/a)$, ensuring the angle is in the correct quadrant.

##### **1.4 Trigonometric and Exponential Forms**
Besides the standard form $a+bi$, complex numbers can be expressed in other ways that are useful for certain operations.

1.  **Trigonometric Form:** Using the modulus $r$ and argument $\theta$, we can express the real and imaginary parts as $a = r\cos\theta$ and $b = r\sin\theta$. Substituting these into the standard form gives:
    $$ z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) $$

2.  **Exponential (or Polar) Form:** This form is derived from **Euler's Formula**, a fundamental relationship in mathematics:
    $$ e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta $$
    By substituting this into the trigonometric form, we get the compact exponential form:
    $$ z = re^{i\theta} $$

##### **1.5 De Moivre's Theorem**
**De Moivre's Theorem** provides a straightforward method for calculating the power of a complex number when it is in trigonometric form. For any complex number $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$ and any integer $n$, the theorem states:
$$ z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta)) $$
In exponential form, this is equivalent to $(re^{i\theta})^n = r^n e^{in\theta}$. This theorem is incredibly useful for finding powers and roots of complex numbers efficiently.

##### **1.6 Principles of Mathematical Induction**
**Mathematical induction** is a powerful and rigorous proof technique used to demonstrate that a statement, property, or formula is true for all natural numbers (or all integers from a certain starting point). It does not rely on observation or patterns but on logical deduction. The process is often compared to the *domino effect*: if you knock over the first domino, and you know that each domino will knock over the next, then all the dominoes will eventually fall.

A proof by induction consists of three main steps:

1.  **Base Case:** Verify that the statement holds true for the first value, usually $n=1$. This is like knocking over the first domino.
2.  **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that the statement is true for an arbitrary natural number, $k$. This is the assumption that *some* domino, the $k$-th one, falls.
3.  **Inductive Step:** Prove that if the statement is true for $k$, it must also be true for the next number, $k+1$. This establishes the linkâ€”that if the $k$-th domino falls, it will knock over the ($k+1$)-th domino.

Once these steps are completed, the principle of mathematical induction allows us to conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers $n$.

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Set**: A collection of distinct objects or elements.
*   **Complex Number**: A number of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit.
*   **Imaginary Unit ($i$)**: The number defined by the property $i^2 = -1$.
*   **Complex Plane**: A two-dimensional plane used to represent complex numbers geometrically, with a real axis and an imaginary axis.
*   **Modulus ($r$ or $|z|$)**: The magnitude or absolute value of a complex number, representing its distance from the origin on the complex plane.
*   **Argument ($\theta$)**: The angle of a complex number's vector on the complex plane, measured from the positive real axis.
*   **Euler's Formula**: The identity $e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$ that links complex exponentials with trigonometric functions.
*   **De Moivre's Theorem**: A formula used to compute powers of complex numbers in trigonometric form: $z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))$.
*   **Mathematical Induction**: A formal proof technique used to establish the truth of a statement for all natural numbers.

#### **3. Formulas**

*   **Standard Form of a Complex Number**: $z = a + bi$
*   **Imaginary Unit**: $i = \sqrt{-1}$
*   **Modulus of a Complex Number**: $r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
*   **Argument of a Complex Number**: $\theta = \arctan(b/a)$
*   **Trigonometric Form**: $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$
*   **Euler's Formula**: $e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$
*   **Exponential (Polar) Form**: $z = re^{i\theta}$
*   **De Moivre's Theorem**: $z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))$

#### **4. Mistakes**

*   **Forgetting the Quadrant for the Argument**: Simply using $\theta = \tan^{-1}(b/a)$ can give the wrong angle if the complex number is not in the first or fourth quadrant. **Why it's wrong**: The arctan function on most calculators has a limited range (typically $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$), so you must adjust the angle based on the signs of $a$ and $b$ to place it in the correct quadrant.
*   **Confusing the Imaginary Part**: Stating that the imaginary part of $a+bi$ is $bi$. **Why it's wrong**: The imaginary part is just the real number coefficient $b$, not the term with $i$.
*   **Skipping the Base Case in Induction**: Starting an induction proof with the inductive hypothesis without first proving the statement is true for $n=1$. **Why it's wrong**: The entire chain of logic depends on the first "domino" falling. Without a true base case, the proof is invalid.
*   **Assuming P(k+1) is True**: In the inductive step, assuming the conclusion for $k+1$ is true, rather than using the assumption for $k$ to prove the case for $k+1$. **Why it's wrong**: This is circular reasoning. The goal is to prove the implication `if P(k) is true, then P(k+1) is true`, not to assume it.
*   **Incorrectly Applying De Moivre's Theorem**: Applying the theorem to a complex number that is not in trigonometric or polar form. **Why it's wrong**: The theorem explicitly requires the modulus $r$ and argument $\theta$ to work. You cannot simply raise the real and imaginary parts to the power $n$.

1.  **Expand the expression:** Use the formula $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.
    $$ (2+3i)^2 = 2^2 + 2(2)(3i) + (3i)^2 $$
2.  **Simplify the terms:**
    $$ 4 + 12i + 9i^2 $$
3.  **Substitute $i^2 = -1$:**
    $$ 4 + 12i + 9(-1) $$
    $$ 4 + 12i - 9 $$
4.  **Combine the real parts:**
    $$ (4 - 9) + 12i = -5 + 12i $$

**Answer:** The result is **$-5 + 12i$**.

##### **5.2. Complex Number Division**
**Question:** Find the values of $P$ and $Q$ if $P+Qi = \frac{3-i}{1+i}$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Multiply by the complex conjugate:** To remove the imaginary unit from the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of $1+i$, which is $1-i$.
    $$ \frac{3-i}{1+i} \times \frac{1-i}{1-i} $$
2.  **Expand the numerator:**
    $$ (3-i)(1-i) = 3 - 3i - i + i^2 = 3 - 4i - 1 = 2 - 4i $$
3.  **Expand the denominator:**
    $$ (1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2 $$
4.  **Combine and simplify:**
    $$ \frac{2-4i}{2} = 1 - 2i $$
5.  **Identify P and Q:** By comparing $1-2i$ with $P+Qi$, we find $P=1$ and $Q=-2$.

**Answer:** $P=1$, $Q=-2$.

##### **5.3. Convert to Trigonometric/Exponential Form**
**Question:** Write the complex number $Z = 1+i$ in trigonometric and exponential forms.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Identify $a$ and $b$:** For $Z=1+i$, we have $a=1$ and $b=1$.
2.  **Calculate the modulus ($r$):**
    $$ r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2} $$
3.  **Calculate the argument ($\theta$):**
    $$ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{1}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4} \text{ radians} $$
    Since $a$ and $b$ are both positive, the point is in the first quadrant, so this angle is correct.
4.  **Write the trigonometric form:** $Z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$
    $$ Z = \sqrt{2}\left(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right) $$
5.  **Write the exponential form:** $Z = re^{i\theta}$
    $$ Z = \sqrt{2}e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} $$

**Answer:** Trigonometric form is **$\sqrt{2}(\cos(\pi/4) + i\sin(\pi/4))$** and exponential form is **$\sqrt{2}e^{i\pi/4}$**.
</details>

##### **5.4. Apply De Moivre's Theorem**
**Question:** Using De Moivre's Theorem, simplify $Z = (2+2i)^3$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Convert to trigonometric form:** First, we need to express $2+2i$ in the form $r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$.
    *   $a=2, b=2$
    *   Modulus: $r = \sqrt{2^2+2^2} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}$.
    *   Argument: $\theta = \tan^{-1}(2/2) = \tan^{-1}(1) = \pi/4$.
    *   So, $2+2i = 2\sqrt{2}(\cos(\pi/4) + i\sin(\pi/4))$.
2.  **Apply De Moivre's Theorem:** $Z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))$ with $n=3$.
    $$ Z = (2\sqrt{2})^3 \left(\cos\left(3 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(3 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right) $$
3.  **Simplify the expression:**
    *   $(2\sqrt{2})^3 = 8 \cdot (\sqrt{2})^3 = 8 \cdot 2\sqrt{2} = 16\sqrt{2}$.
    *   $\cos(3\pi/4) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
    *   $\sin(3\pi/4) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
4.  **Substitute the values back:**
    $$ Z = 16\sqrt{2} \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) $$
5.  **Distribute and simplify:**
    $$ Z = -16\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \cdot 16\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $$
    $$ Z = -16 \cdot \frac{2}{2} + i \cdot 16 \cdot \frac{2}{2} $$
    $$ Z = -16 + 16i $$

**Answer:** The simplified form is **$-16 + 16i$**.

##### **5.5. Induction with Divisibility**
**Question:** Use mathematical induction to show that for all positive integers $n$, $P(n) = 5^{2n} + 3n - 1$ is an integer multiple of 9.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Base Case (n=1):**
    $$ P(1) = 5^{2(1)} + 3(1) - 1 = 25 + 3 - 1 = 27 $$
    Since $27 = 9 \times 3$, the statement holds for $n=1$.
2.  **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for some positive integer $k$. That is, assume $5^{2k} + 3k - 1$ is a multiple of 9.
    This means $5^{2k} + 3k - 1 = 9m$ for some integer $m$.
    We can rearrange this as $5^{2k} = 9m - 3k + 1$.
3.  **Inductive Step:** We must show that $P(k+1) = 5^{2(k+1)} + 3(k+1) - 1$ is also a multiple of 9.
    $$ P(k+1) = 5^{2k+2} + 3k + 3 - 1 $$
    $$ P(k+1) = 5^2 \cdot 5^{2k} + 3k + 2 $$
    $$ P(k+1) = 25 \cdot 5^{2k} + 3k + 2 $$
    Now, substitute $5^{2k}$ from our hypothesis:
    $$ P(k+1) = 25(9m - 3k + 1) + 3k + 2 $$
    $$ P(k+1) = 225m - 75k + 25 + 3k + 2 $$
    $$ P(k+1) = 225m - 72k + 27 $$
    Factor out a 9:
    $$ P(k+1) = 9(25m - 8k + 3) $$
    Since $m$ and $k$ are integers, $(25m - 8k + 3)$ is also an integer. Thus, $P(k+1)$ is a multiple of 9.

**Answer:** By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers $n$.
</details>

##### **5.6. Induction with Products**
**Question:** Use mathematical induction to show that for all positive integers $n$, $P(n) = n(n+1)(n+2)$ is an integer multiple of 6.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Base Case (n=1):**
    $$ P(1) = 1(1+1)(1+2) = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 6 $$
    Since $6 = 6 \times 1$, the statement holds for $n=1$.
2.  **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for some positive integer $k$. That is, assume $k(k+1)(k+2) = 6m$ for some integer $m$.
3.  **Inductive Step:** We must show that $P(k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)(k+3)$ is a multiple of 6.
    $$ P(k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)(k+3) $$
    $$ P(k+1) = (k(k+1)(k+2)) + 3(k+1)(k+2) $$
    From our hypothesis, we know $k(k+1)(k+2)$ is a multiple of 6. So we can write:
    $$ P(k+1) = 6m + 3(k+1)(k+2) $$
    Now we need to show that $3(k+1)(k+2)$ is also a multiple of 6. Notice that $(k+1)$ and $(k+2)$ are two consecutive integers. One of them must be an even number. Let's say $(k+1)(k+2) = 2p$ for some integer $p$.
    $$ P(k+1) = 6m + 3(2p) = 6m + 6p = 6(m+p) $$
    Since $m$ and $p$ are integers, $(m+p)$ is also an integer. Thus, $P(k+1)$ is a multiple of 6.

**Answer:** By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers $n$.
</details>

##### **5.7. Induction with Exponents**
**Question:** Use mathematical induction to show that for all positive integers $n$, $P(n) = 7^{2n+1} + 1$ is an integer multiple of 8.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Base Case (n=1):**
    $$ P(1) = 7^{2(1)+1} + 1 = 7^3 + 1 = 343 + 1 = 344 $$
    Since $344 = 8 \times 43$, the statement holds for $n=1$.
2.  **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for some positive integer $k$. That is, assume $7^{2k+1} + 1 = 8m$ for some integer $m$.
    We can rearrange this as $7^{2k+1} = 8m - 1$.
3.  **Inductive Step:** We must show that $P(k+1) = 7^{2(k+1)+1} + 1$ is a multiple of 8.
    $$ P(k+1) = 7^{2k+2+1} + 1 = 7^{2k+3} + 1 $$
    $$ P(k+1) = 7^2 \cdot 7^{2k+1} + 1 $$
    $$ P(k+1) = 49 \cdot 7^{2k+1} + 1 $$
    Now, substitute $7^{2k+1}$ from our hypothesis:
    $$ P(k+1) = 49(8m - 1) + 1 $$
    $$ P(k+1) = 392m - 49 + 1 $$
    $$ P(k+1) = 392m - 48 $$
    Factor out an 8:
    $$ P(k+1) = 8(49m - 6) $$
    Since $m$ is an integer, $(49m - 6)$ is also an integer. Thus, $P(k+1)$ is a multiple of 8.

**Answer:** By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers $n$.
