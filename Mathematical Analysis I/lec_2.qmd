#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Core Concepts of Functions**
A **function** is a rule that assigns a *single, unique output* to every *input*. The set of all permissible inputs is called the **domain**, and the set of all resulting outputs is the **range**. If a function `f` takes an input `x` to produce an output `y`, we write $y = f(x)$.

*   **Implicit Domain**: When a function is defined by a formula without a specified domain, the domain is assumed to be the largest set of real numbers for which the formula gives real-valued outputs. For example, for $f(x) = \frac{1}{x-2}$, the domain is all real numbers except $x=2$.
*   **Graph of a Function**: The graph is a visual representation consisting of all points $(x, f(x))$ on the Cartesian plane. The value $f(x)$ represents the height of the graph at point $x$. The formal definition of the graph is the set $\{(x, f(x)) | x \in D\}$, where $D$ is the domain.

##### **1.2 Special Step Functions: Floor and Ceiling**
*   **Floor Function** (Greatest Integer Function): Denoted $\lfloor x \rfloor$, this function rounds a number *down* to the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. For example, $\lfloor 3.7 \rfloor = 3$ and $\lfloor -2.1 \rfloor = -3$.
*   **Ceiling Function** (Least Integer Function): Denoted $\lceil x \rceil$, this function rounds a number *up* to the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$. For example, $\lceil 3.7 \rceil = 4$ and $\lceil -2.1 \rceil = -2$.

##### **1.3 Function Behavior: Monotonicity**
A function is **monotone** on an interval if it consistently increases or decreases.

*   **Increasing**: $f(x_1) \le f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$.
*   **Strictly Increasing**: $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$.
*   **Decreasing**: $f(x_1) \ge f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$.
*   **Strictly Decreasing**: $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$.

A function that is *strictly monotone* (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing) on its domain is guaranteed to be **one-to-one**.

##### **1.4 Combining Functions**
Functions can be combined arithmetically or through composition. For arithmetic combinations, the domain is the intersection of the individual domains.

*   **Arithmetic Operations**: $(f+g)(x) = f(x)+g(x)$; $(f-g)(x) = f(x)-g(x)$; $(fg)(x) = f(x)g(x)$; and $(f/g)(x) = f(x)/g(x)$, with the added domain restriction that $g(x) \neq 0$.
*   **Composition**: The composition $(f \circ g)(x)$ is defined as $f(g(x))$. The input $x$ must be in the domain of $g$, and the output $g(x)$ must be in the domain of $f$. *The order of composition is critical*, as $(f \circ g)(x)$ is generally not equal to $(g \circ f)(x)$.

##### **1.5 Inverse Functions**
*   **One-to-One Function**: A function is **one-to-one** if no two distinct inputs produce the same output. This can be verified visually with the *horizontal line test*â€”if no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, the function is one-to-one.
*   **Inverse Function**: If a function $f$ is one-to-one, it has an **inverse function**, denoted $f^{-1}$, that "reverses" its action. If $f(a) = b$, then $f^{-1}(b) = a$. The domain of $f^{-1}$ is the range of $f$, and the range of $f^{-1}$ is the domain of $f$. The graph of $f^{-1}$ is a reflection of the graph of $f$ across the line $y=x$.

##### **1.6 Function Symmetry: Even and Odd Functions**
For a function to be even or odd, its domain must be symmetric about the origin (if $x$ is in the domain, $-x$ must also be).

*   **Even Function**: $f$ is **even** if $f(-x) = f(x)$. Its graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis (e.g., $f(x) = x^2$, $f(x) = \cos x$).
*   **Odd Function**: $f$ is **odd** if $f(-x) = -f(x)$. Its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin (e.g., $f(x) = x^3$, $f(x) = \sin x$).

Any function with a symmetric domain can be uniquely decomposed into the sum of an even and an odd function:

*   **Even Part**: $f_{\text{even}}(x) = \frac{f(x) + f(-x)}{2}$
*   **Odd Part**: $f_{\text{odd}}(x) = \frac{f(x) - f(-x)}{2}$

##### **1.7 Elementary Functions**

###### **1.7.1 Power, Polynomial, and Rational Functions**
*   **Power Function**: A function of the form $f(x) = x^a$, where $a$ is a real number. This includes integer powers ($x^2$), roots ($x^{1/2} = \sqrt{x}$), and reciprocals ($x^{-1} = 1/x$).
*   **Polynomial Function**: A sum of power functions with non-negative integer exponents: $p(x) = a_n x^n + \dots + a_1 x + a_0$. The highest exponent $n$ is the **degree** of the polynomial.
*   **Rational Function**: A ratio of two polynomials, $f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$. Its domain excludes any values of $x$ for which $q(x)=0$.

###### **1.7.2 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions**
*   **Exponential Function**: $f(x) = a^x$, where the base $a > 0$ and $a \neq 1$. Its domain is all real numbers, and its range is $(0, \infty)$.
*   **Logarithmic Function**: $f(x) = \log_a(x)$, the inverse of the exponential function. The expression $\log_a(x)$ gives the exponent to which the base $a$ must be raised to obtain $x$. Its domain is $(0, \infty)$, and its range is all real numbers.

###### **1.7.3 Trigonometric Functions and Their Inverses**
Trigonometric functions relate an angle $\theta$ to the coordinates $(x, y)$ of a point on a circle of radius $r$. They are **periodic**, meaning their values repeat.

*   **Definitions**: $\sin \theta = y/r$, $\cos \theta = x/r$, $\tan \theta = y/x$, etc.
*   **Periodicity**: The period of $\sin x, \cos x, \sec x, \csc x$ is $2\pi$. The period of $\tan x$ and $\cot x$ is $\pi$.
*   **Inverse Trigonometric Functions**: Because they are not one-to-one, we must restrict the domain of trigonometric functions to create their inverses (e.g., $\arcsin x$, $\arccos x$). For example, $\arcsin x$ is defined for inputs in $[-1, 1]$ and produces an angle in $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.

###### **1.7.4 Hyperbolic Functions and Their Inverses**
Hyperbolic functions are combinations of exponential functions and are analogous to trigonometric functions.

*   **Definitions**: $\sinh x = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$ and $\cosh x = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$. The other four are defined similarly to their trigonometric counterparts (e.g., $\tanh x = \sinh x / \cosh x$).
*   **Inverse Hyperbolic Functions**: These are the inverses of the hyperbolic functions (with domain restrictions where needed, like for $\cosh x$). They can be expressed using natural logarithms. For instance, $\text{arsinh}(x) = \ln(x + \sqrt{x^2+1})$.

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Function**: A rule assigning each input from a domain to exactly one output.
*   **Domain**: The set of all possible input values for a function.
*   **Range**: The set of all possible output values of a function.
*   **One-to-One Function**: A function where each output corresponds to a unique input.
*   **Inverse Function ($f^{-1}$)**: A function that reverses the mapping of a one-to-one function.
*   **Even Function**: A function satisfying $f(-x) = f(x)$, symmetric about the y-axis.
*   **Odd Function**: A function satisfying $f(-x) = -f(x)$, symmetric about the origin.
*   **Periodic Function**: A function that repeats its values at regular intervals (the period).
*   **Polynomial**: A function expressed as a sum of non-negative integer powers of a variable.
*   **Degree of a Polynomial**: The highest exponent of the variable in a polynomial.
*   **Rational Function**: A function that is the ratio of two polynomials.
*   **Exponential Function**: A function of the form $f(x) = a^x$ where $a$ is a positive constant.
*   **Logarithmic Function**: The inverse of an exponential function, $f(x) = \log_a(x)$.
*   **Hyperbolic Functions**: Functions defined as combinations of $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$, such as $\sinh x$ and $\cosh x$.
*   **Composition of Functions**: An operation $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$ where one function is applied to the result of another.

#### **3. Formulas**

*   **Even Part of a Function**: $f_{\text{even}}(x) = \frac{f(x) + f(-x)}{2}$
*   **Odd Part of a Function**: $f_{\text{odd}}(x) = \frac{f(x) - f(-x)}{2}$
*   **Composition**: $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$
*   **Pythagorean Identities**:
    *   $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$
    *   $1 + \tan^2 x = \sec^2 x$
    *   $1 + \cot^2 x = \csc^2 x$
*   **Angle Addition Formulas**:
    *   $\sin(x \pm y) = \sin x \cos y \pm \cos x \sin y$
    *   $\cos(x \pm y) = \cos x \cos y \mp \sin x \sin y$
*   **Hyperbolic Identity**: $\cosh^2 x - \sinh^2 x = 1$
*   **Hyperbolic Definitions**:
    *   $\sinh x = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$
    *   $\cosh x = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$
*   **Inverse Trig Complementary Angles**: $\arcsin x + \arccos x = \frac{\pi}{2}$
*   **Logarithmic Forms of Inverse Hyperbolic Functions**:
    *   $\text{arsinh}(x) = \ln(x + \sqrt{x^2+1})$
    *   $\text{arcosh}(x) = \ln(x + \sqrt{x^2-1})$ for $x \ge 1$
    *   $\text{artanh}(x) = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)$ for $|x| < 1$
*   **Change of Logarithm Base**: $\log_b a = \frac{\ln a}{\ln b}$

#### **4. Mistakes**

*   **Confusing Inverse Notation for a Reciprocal:** Interpreting $f^{-1}(x)$ as $1/f(x)$. **Why it's wrong:** The $-1$ superscript denotes an inverse function, which "undoes" the function's operation. For example, $\sin^{-1}(x)$ is $\arcsin(x)$, whereas $(\sin x)^{-1}$ is $1/\sin x = \csc x$.
*   **Assuming Function Composition is Commutative:** Thinking that $f(g(x))$ is always the same as $g(f(x))$. **Why it's wrong:** The order of operations matters. Applying function $g$ then function $f$ is a different sequence of transformations than applying $f$ then $g$.
*   **Incorrectly Simplifying Logarithms:** Applying rules that don't exist, such as writing $\ln(a+b)$ as $\ln(a) + \ln(b)$. **Why it's wrong:** Logarithm rules apply to products, quotients, and powers, not sums or differences. The correct rule is $\ln(ab) = \ln(a) + \ln(b)$.
*   **Mixing Up Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Identities:** Believing that $\sinh^2 x + \cosh^2 x = 1$. **Why it's wrong:** While analogous, the main hyperbolic identity has a minus sign: $\cosh^2 x - \sinh^2 x = 1$. This difference stems from their definitions using exponential functions.
*   **Ignoring the Domain and Range of Inverse Trig Functions:** Calculating $\arcsin(\sin(2\pi))$ as $2\pi$. **Why it's wrong:** The range of $\arcsin(x)$ is restricted to $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. The correct evaluation is $\sin(2\pi) = 0$, and $\arcsin(0) = 0$. The formula $\arcsin(\sin(x)) = x$ is only valid for $x$ within the restricted range.
*   **Forgetting to Find the Domain of a Composite Function Correctly:** To find the domain of $f(g(x))$, only considering the domain of the final simplified function. **Why it's wrong:** The domain must satisfy two conditions: $x$ must be in the domain of the inner function $g$, and the output $g(x)$ must be in the domain of the outer function $f$.

#### **5. Examples**

##### **5.1. Domain of a Composite Function**
**Question:** Let $f(x) = \sqrt{x-4}$ and $g(x) = x^2$. Find the domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Write the composite function**:
    $$ (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = \sqrt{x^2 - 4} $$
2.  **Determine the domain condition for the outer function `f`**: The input to $f(u) = \sqrt{u-4}$ must be greater than or equal to 4. So, $u \ge 4$.
3.  **Apply this condition to the inner function `g(x)`**: The output of $g(x)$, which is $x^2$, becomes the input for $f$. Therefore, we must have:
    $$ x^2 \ge 4 $$
4.  **Solve the inequality**: Taking the square root of both sides gives $|x| \ge 2$. This means $x \ge 2$ or $x \le -2$.
5.  **Check the domain of `g(x)`**: The domain of $g(x)=x^2$ is all real numbers, so this adds no further restrictions.

**Answer:** The domain is **$(-\infty, -2] \cup [2, \infty)$**.

##### **5.2. Decomposing a Function into Even and Odd Parts**
**Question:** Decompose the function $f(x) = e^x$ into its even and odd parts.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find $f(-x)$**:
    $$ f(-x) = e^{-x} $$
2.  **Use the formula for the even part**:
    $$ f_{\text{even}}(x) = \frac{f(x) + f(-x)}{2} = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} $$
3.  **Recognize the result**: This is the definition of the hyperbolic cosine.
    $$ f_{\text{even}}(x) = \cosh(x) $$
4.  **Use the formula for the odd part**:
    $$ f_{\text{odd}}(x) = \frac{f(x) - f(-x)}{2} = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} $$
5.  **Recognize the result**: This is the definition of the hyperbolic sine.
    $$ f_{\text{odd}}(x) = \sinh(x) $$

**Answer:** The even part is **$\cosh(x)$** and the odd part is **$\sinh(x)$**. (Thus, $e^x = \cosh x + \sinh x$).
</details>

##### **5.3. Proving a Trigonometric Identity**
**Question:** Prove the identity $\frac{\sin(2x)}{1 + \cos(2x)} = \tan(x)$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Recall the double-angle formulas**:
    *   $\sin(2x) = 2 \sin x \cos x$
    *   $\cos(2x) = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x$. Another useful form is $2\cos^2 x - 1$.
2.  **Substitute the formulas into the left-hand side**: Using the form $\cos(2x) = 2\cos^2 x - 1$ will be helpful for simplifying the denominator.
    $$ \frac{2 \sin x \cos x}{1 + (2\cos^2 x - 1)} $$
3.  **Simplify the denominator**:
    $$ \frac{2 \sin x \cos x}{2\cos^2 x} $$
4.  **Cancel common terms**: Cancel the `2` and one factor of `cos x` from the numerator and denominator.
    $$ \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} $$
5.  **Recognize the result**: This is the definition of $\tan x$. The left side equals the right side.

**Answer:** The identity is proven.
</details>

##### **5.4. Finding an Inverse Function**
**Question:** Find the inverse of the function $f(x) = 5e^{2x} - 3$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Replace $f(x)$ with $y$**:
    $$ y = 5e^{2x} - 3 $$
2.  **Swap $x$ and $y$**:
    $$ x = 5e^{2y} - 3 $$
3.  **Solve for $y$ by isolating the exponential term**:
    $$ x + 3 = 5e^{2y} $$
    $$ \frac{x+3}{5} = e^{2y} $$
4.  **Take the natural logarithm of both sides**:
    $$ \ln\left(\frac{x+3}{5}\right) = \ln(e^{2y}) $$
    $$ \ln\left(\frac{x+3}{5}\right) = 2y $$
5.  **Isolate $y$**:
    $$ y = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{x+3}{5}\right) $$
6.  **Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$**:
    $$ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{x+3}{5}\right) $$

**Answer:** The inverse function is **$f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{x+3}{5}\right)$**.
</details>

##### **5.5. Using Inverse Trigonometric Relationships**
**Question:** Find the exact value of $\tan(\arccos(\frac{3}{5}))$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Set up the problem**: Let $\theta = \arccos(\frac{3}{5})$. This means $\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}$ and $\theta$ is in the interval $[0, \pi]$.
2.  **Visualize with a right triangle**: Since $\cos(\theta)$ is positive, $\theta$ is in Quadrant I. We can draw a right triangle where the adjacent side is 3 and the hypotenuse is 5.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->
    
3.  **Find the missing side**: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the opposite side ($o$).
    $$ 3^2 + o^2 = 5^2 $$
    $$ 9 + o^2 = 25 $$
    $$ o^2 = 16 \implies o = 4 $$
4.  **Calculate the tangent**: The problem is now to find $\tan(\theta)$. From the triangle, $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$.
    $$ \tan(\theta) = \frac{4}{3} $$

**Answer:** **$\frac{4}{3}$**.
</details>

##### **5.6. Converting Inverse Hyperbolic Functions**
**Question:** Express $\text{artanh}(1/2)$ in terms of a natural logarithm.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Recall the logarithmic formula for artanh(x)**:
    $$ \text{artanh}(x) = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right) $$
2.  **Substitute $x = 1/2$ into the formula**:
    $$ \text{artanh}(1/2) = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{1+1/2}{1-1/2}\right) $$
3.  **Simplify the fraction inside the logarithm**:
    $$ \frac{1+1/2}{1-1/2} = \frac{3/2}{1/2} = 3 $$
4.  **Write the final expression**:
    $$ \text{artanh}(1/2) = \frac{1}{2} \ln(3) $$

**Answer:** **$\frac{1}{2} \ln(3)$** or **$\ln(\sqrt{3})$**.
</details>

##### **5.7. Proving an Inverse Trig Identity**
**Question:** Prove that $\arcsin(-x) = -\arcsin(x)$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Start with the definition**: Let $\theta = \arcsin(-x)$. By definition, this means:
    *   $\sin(\theta) = -x$
    *   $-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}$
2.  **Manipulate the equation**: Multiply both sides of $\sin(\theta) = -x$ by -1 to get:
    $$ -\sin(\theta) = x $$
3.  **Use the property of the sine function**: Sine is an odd function, so $-\sin(\theta) = \sin(-\theta)$.
    $$ \sin(-\theta) = x $$
4.  **Consider the range**: Since $-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}$, multiplying by -1 reverses the inequalities, giving $\frac{\pi}{2} \ge -\theta \ge -\frac{\pi}{2}$. The angle $-\theta$ is also in the valid range for the output of arcsin.
5.  **Take the arcsin of both sides**: From $\sin(-\theta) = x$, we can conclude that:
    $$ -\theta = \arcsin(x) $$
6.  **Substitute back**: We started with $\theta = \arcsin(-x)$. Substitute this back into the equation.
    $$ -(\arcsin(-x)) = \arcsin(x) $$
    Multiplying by -1 gives the desired identity.
    $$ \arcsin(-x) = -\arcsin(x) $$

**Answer:** The identity is proven.
