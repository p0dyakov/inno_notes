#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Complex Numbers in Trigonometric Form**
A **complex number** is a number that can be expressed in the form **$z = x + iy$**, where *x* and *y* are real numbers, and **$i$** is the imaginary unit, satisfying the equation $i^2 = -1$. Here, *x* is the *real part* and *y* is the *imaginary part*. While this is the standard Cartesian form, the **trigonometric form** (also known as polar form) is often more convenient for operations like multiplication and exponentiation.

To convert a complex number to its trigonometric form, we need two components: the **modulus** and the **argument**.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.1.1 Modulus**
The **modulus** of a complex number, denoted as $r$ or $|z|$, represents its distance from the origin (0,0) in the complex plane. It's a non-negative real number calculated using a formula analogous to the Pythagorean theorem.
$$
r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

###### **1.1.2 Argument**
The **argument** of a complex number, denoted by $\theta$, is the angle formed by the positive real axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point $z = x + iy$ in the complex plane. The angle is measured in radians and is typically in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$.

The argument can be determined from the relations:
$$
\cos\theta = \frac{x}{r}, \quad \sin\theta = \frac{y}{r}, \quad \tan\theta = \frac{y}{x}
$$
However, using $\theta = \arctan(y/x)$ directly is insufficient because the arctan function only returns values in $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$, which covers only Quadrants I and IV. To find the correct angle, you must consider the signs of *x* and *y* to identify the correct quadrant:

*   **Quadrant I** ($x > 0, y \ge 0$): $\theta = \arctan(y/x)$
*   **Quadrant II** ($x < 0, y > 0$): $\theta = \arctan(y/x) + \pi$
*   **Quadrant III** ($x < 0, y < 0$): $\theta = \arctan(y/x) + \pi$
*   **Quadrant IV** ($x > 0, y < 0$): $\theta = \arctan(y/x) + 2\pi$

###### **1.1.3 The Trigonometric Form**
Once the modulus $r$ and argument $\theta$ are found, the complex number can be written in its **trigonometric form**:
$$
z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)
$$

##### **1.2 De Moivre's Theorem and Its Applications**

###### **1.2.1 Powers of Complex Numbers**
**De Moivre's Theorem** provides a straightforward method for raising a complex number in trigonometric form to an integer power. It states that to raise a complex number to the power $n$, you raise the modulus to the power $n$ and multiply the argument by $n$.
$$
[r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)]^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))
$$

###### **1.2.2 Roots of Complex Numbers**
The theorem can be extended to find the *n-th roots* of a complex number. A complex number $z$ has exactly **$n$** distinct *n-th roots*, which are evenly spaced on a circle in the complex plane. The formula for the roots is:
$$
\sqrt[n]{z} = \sqrt[n]{r} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right)
$$
where $k$ is an integer that ranges from $0$ to $n-1$.

##### **1.3 Geometric Representation of Complex Numbers**
Every complex number $z = x + iy$ corresponds to a unique point $(x,y)$ in a two-dimensional plane called the **complex plane**. The horizontal axis is the *real axis*, and the vertical axis is the *imaginary axis*.

The expression $|z - a| = r$ describes the set of all points $z$ that are at a fixed distance $r$ from a central point $a$. Geometrically, this represents a **circle** centered at $a$ with radius $r$.

*   $|z - a| \le r$ describes a **closed disk** (the circle and its interior).
*   $|z - a| < r$ describes an **open disk** (the interior of the circle only).
*   $|z - a| \ge r$ describes the **exterior of a disk** including its boundary.

##### **1.4 Introduction to Set Theory**
A **set** is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, which are called **elements** or **members** of the set. The language of sets is fundamental to modern mathematics.

###### **1.4.1 Basic Notation and Definitions**
*   **Element of a set**: If an object *x* is an element of a set *A*, we write $x \in A$. If not, we write $x \notin A$.
*   **Empty Set**: A set with no elements is called the **empty set**, denoted by $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$.
*   **Subset**: A set *A* is a **subset** of a set *B* if every element of *A* is also an element of *B*. This is denoted $A \subset B$.
*   **Equality**: Two sets *A* and *B* are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. This means $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$.

###### **1.4.2 Set Operations**
*   **Union ($\cup$):** The union of two sets *A* and *B*, written $A \cup B$, is the set containing all elements that are in *A*, or in *B*, or in both.
*   **Intersection ($\cap$):** The intersection of *A* and *B*, written $A \cap B$, is the set containing all elements that are in both *A* and *B*.
*   **Difference ($\setminus$):** The difference of *A* and *B*, written $A \setminus B$, is the set of all elements that are in *A* but not in *B*.
*   **Complement ($A^c$):** If there is a universal set *U*, the complement of *A* is the set of all elements in *U* that are not in *A*, i.e., $A^c = U \setminus A$.

##### **1.5 The Real Number System**
The **real numbers** ($\mathbb{R}$) form the foundation of calculus and analysis. They can be visualized as all points on an infinitely long number line. They are defined by a set of axioms and contain several important subsets.

###### **1.5.1 Subsets of Real Numbers**
*   **Natural Numbers ($\mathbb{N}$)**: The counting numbers: $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$.
*   **Integers ($\mathbb{Z}$)**: All whole numbers, both positive, negative, and zero: $\{\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots\}$.
*   **Rational Numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$)**: Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction $p/q$, where *p* and *q* are integers and $q \neq 0$. Their decimal representations are either terminating or repeating.
*   **Irrational Numbers**: Real numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. Their decimal representations are non-terminating and non-repeating (e.g., $\pi, \sqrt{2}, e$).

###### **1.5.2 Key Properties of Real Numbers**
*   **Archimedean Property**: This property states that for any two positive real numbers *x* and *y*, there is an integer *n* such that $nx > y$. Intuitively, this means there are no "infinitely large" or "infinitely small" real numbers.
*   **Density**: The rational and irrational numbers are *dense* in the real numbers. This means that between any two distinct real numbers, you can always find another rational number and another irrational number.

###### **1.5.3 Countability**
A set is **countable** if its elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. The sets $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, and $\mathbb{Q}$ are all countable. An infinite set that is not countable is called **uncountable**. The set of real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) is uncountable, which implies that in a sense, there are "more" real numbers than rational numbers.

##### **1.6 Mathematical Induction**
The **Principle of Mathematical Induction** is a powerful proof technique used to prove that a statement $P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers $n$ (or all integers from a certain starting point). It is often compared to a domino effect.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

To prove a statement by induction, two steps are required:
1.  **Base Case**: Prove that the statement is true for the first value, usually $n=1$. (This is like tipping over the first domino).
2.  **Inductive Step**: Assume that the statement is true for an arbitrary natural number $k$, i.e., assume $P(k)$ is true (this is the *inductive hypothesis*). Then, using this assumption, prove that the statement must also be true for the next number, $k+1$, i.e., prove $P(k+1)$ is true. (This is like proving that if any given domino falls, it will knock over the next one).

If both steps are successfully completed, the principle of mathematical induction guarantees that the statement is true for all natural numbers $n$.

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Complex Number**: A number of the form $x + iy$, where *x* and *y* are real numbers and $i = \sqrt{-1}$.
*   **Modulus**: The distance of a complex number from the origin in the complex plane, given by $r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
*   **Argument**: The angle $\theta$ a complex number makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane.
*   **De Moivre's Theorem**: A formula for computing powers of complex numbers, stating that $[r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)]^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))$.
*   **Set**: A collection of distinct objects, known as elements or members.
*   **Subset**: A set `A` is a subset of `B` if all elements of `A` are also elements of `B`.
*   **Union**: The set of elements present in either of two sets.
*   **Intersection**: The set of elements that two sets have in common.
*   **Countable Set**: An infinite set whose elements can be listed in a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.
*   **Uncountable Set**: An infinite set that is not countable.
*   **Mathematical Induction**: A proof technique to establish that a given statement is true for all natural numbers.

#### **3. Formulas**

*   **Modulus**: $r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
*   **Argument Relations**: $\cos\theta = x/r, \sin\theta = y/r$
*   **Trigonometric Form**: $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$
*   **De Moivre's Theorem (Powers)**: $[r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)]^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))$
*   **De Moivre's Theorem (Roots)**: $\sqrt[n]{z} = \sqrt[n]{r} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right)$ for $k = 0, 1, \dots, n-1$
*   **De Morgan's Laws**: $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$ and $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$

#### **4. Mistakes**

*   **Incorrectly Calculating the Argument ($\theta$)**: A common mistake is using $\theta = \arctan(y/x)$ without considering the signs of `x` and `y`. **Why it's wrong:** The `arctan` function has a limited range and will give the wrong angle for complex numbers in the second and third quadrants. You must adjust the angle by adding $\pi$ (or using other methods) based on the quadrant.
*   **Applying De Moivre's Theorem to Cartesian Form**: Attempting to calculate $(x+iy)^n$ by simply raising the parts to the power `n`. **Why it's wrong:** De Moivre's Theorem only applies to the trigonometric (polar) form of a complex number. You must convert $x+iy$ to $r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$ before applying the theorem.
*   **Forgetting All n-th Roots**: When asked to find the roots of a complex number, students often find only the principal root (for `k=0`). **Why it's wrong:** A complex number has exactly `n` distinct `n`-th roots. You must cycle through `k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1` to find all of them.
*   **Forgetting the Base Case in Induction**: Starting an induction proof by only showing the inductive step ($P(k) \implies P(k+1)$). **Why it's wrong:** The inductive step only proves that *if* a domino falls, the next one will fall. Without the base case to prove $P(1)$ is true, the chain reaction never starts.
*   **Assuming the Conclusion in the Inductive Step**: When trying to prove $P(k+1)$, it is wrong to start with the statement $P(k+1)$ itself and work backward. **Why it's wrong:** This is a form of circular reasoning. You must start with the inductive hypothesis $P(k)$ and use logical steps to derive the conclusion $P(k+1)$.
*   **Confusing Density with Uncountability**: Believing that because rational numbers are dense in the reals, the sets must have the same "size" (cardinality). **Why it's wrong:** Density describes how elements are distributed, not how many there are. The set of reals is uncountably infinite, a larger order of infinity than the countably infinite set of rationals.

1.  **Find the modulus $r$:**
    $$
    r = |z| = \sqrt{(-2\sqrt{3})^2 + (2)^2} = \sqrt{12 + 4} = \sqrt{16} = 4
    $$
2.  **Determine the quadrant:**
    The real part $x = -2\sqrt{3}$ is negative, and the imaginary part $y = 2$ is positive. This places the number in Quadrant II.
3.  **Find the argument $\theta$:**
    We find a reference angle using $\tan\alpha = |y/x| = |2 / (-2\sqrt{3})| = 1/\sqrt{3}$. The reference angle is $\alpha = \pi/6$.
    For Quadrant II, the angle is $\theta = \pi - \alpha = \pi - \pi/6 = 5\pi/6$.
4.  **Write the trigonometric form:**
    Combine $r$ and $\theta$ into the final form $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$.

**Answer:** **$z = 4(\cos(5\pi/6) + i\sin(5\pi/6))$**

    *   Modulus: $r = \sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{2}$.
    *   Quadrant: $x > 0, y < 0$ is Quadrant IV.
    *   Argument: $\theta = \arctan(-1/1) + 2\pi = -\pi/4 + 2\pi = 7\pi/4$.

    z^8 = (\sqrt{2})^8 \left( \cos\left(8 \cdot \frac{7\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(8 \cdot \frac{7\pi}{4}\right) \right)
    $$
3.  **Simplify the expression:**
    *   $(\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^4 = 16$.
    *   $8 \cdot \frac{7\pi}{4} = 14\pi$.
    *   $\cos(14\pi) = \cos(0) = 1$.
    *   $\sin(14\pi) = \sin(0) = 0$.
    $$

1.  **Convert $z = -8i$ to trigonometric form:**
    *   $x=0, y=-8$.
    *   Modulus: $r = \sqrt{0^2 + (-8)^2} = 8$.
    *   Argument: The point is on the negative imaginary axis, so $\theta = 3\pi/2$.
    *   Trigonometric form: $z = 8(\cos(3\pi/2) + i\sin(3\pi/2))$.
2.  **Apply the n-th root formula with $n=3$:**
    $$
    w_k = \sqrt[3]{8} \left( \cos\left(\frac{3\pi/2 + 2k\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{3\pi/2 + 2k\pi}{3}\right) \right)
    $$
    for $k=0, 1, 2$. The modulus of each root is $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$.
3.  **Calculate the root for $k=0$:**
    $$
    w_0 = 2 \left( \cos\left(\frac{3\pi/2}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{3\pi/2}{3}\right) \right) = 2(\cos(\pi/2) + i\sin(\pi/2)) = 2(0 + i) = 2i
    $$
4.  **Calculate the root for $k=1$:**
    $$
    w_1 = 2 \left( \cos\left(\frac{3\pi/2 + 2\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{3\pi/2 + 2\pi}{3}\right) \right) = 2(\cos(7\pi/6) + i\sin(7\pi/6)) = 2(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}i) = -\sqrt{3} - i
    $$
5.  **Calculate the root for $k=2$:**

    w_2 = 2 \left( \cos\left(\frac{3\pi/2 + 4\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{3\pi/2 + 4\pi}{3}\right) \right) = 2(\cos(11\pi/6) + i\sin(11\pi/6)) = 2(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}i) = \sqrt{3} - i
    $$

##### **5.4. Geometric Interpretation**
**Question:** Describe and sketch the set of points in the complex plane satisfying $1 \le |z + 2| < 3$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Rewrite the expression:** The form $|z - a|$ represents the distance from $z$ to $a$. We rewrite $|z+2|$ as $|z - (-2)|$.
2.  **Interpret the inequalities:**
    *   $|z - (-2)| \ge 1$ means the set of points $z$ whose distance from $-2$ is greater than or equal to 1. This is the exterior of an open disk centered at $-2$ with radius 1, including the boundary circle.
    *   $|z - (-2)| < 3$ means the set of points $z$ whose distance from $-2$ is less than 3. This is the interior of a circle centered at $-2$ with radius 3.
3.  **Combine the conditions:** We need the points that satisfy both conditions. This is the region between the two circles, including the inner circle but excluding the outer circle. This shape is called an annulus.

\begin{tikzpicture}
\fill[gray!30] (0,0) circle (3);
\fill[white] (0,0) circle (1);
\draw[dashed] (0,0) circle (3);
\draw[thick] (0,0) circle (1);
\draw[->] (-4,0) -- (4,0) node[right] {Re};
\draw[->] (0,-3.5) -- (0,3.5) node[above] {Im};
\fill (-2,0) circle (2pt) node[below] {$-2$};
\end{tikzpicture}

**Answer:** The set is an **annulus (a ring-like region) centered at $-2+0i$**. It includes all points on or outside the circle of radius 1 and inside the circle of radius 3.

##### **5.5. Induction with a Summation**
**Question:** Prove by mathematical induction that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i-1) = n^2$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Base Case ($n=1$):**
    The left-hand side (LHS) is $\sum_{i=1}^{1} (2i-1) = 2(1)-1 = 1$.
    The right-hand side (RHS) is $1^2 = 1$.
    Since LHS = RHS, the statement is true for $n=1$.
2.  **Inductive Step:**
    *   **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the formula is true for some arbitrary natural number $k \ge 1$. That is, assume $S_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (2i-1) = k^2$.
    *   **Goal:** We must prove the formula is true for $n = k+1$. We need to show that $S_{k+1} = \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} (2i-1) = (k+1)^2$.
3.  **Proof:**
    Start with the LHS for $k+1$ and use the inductive hypothesis.
    $$
    S_{k+1} = \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} (2i-1) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} (2i-1)\right) + (2(k+1)-1)
    $$
    By the inductive hypothesis, the sum in the parenthesis is $k^2$.
    $$
    S_{k+1} = k^2 + (2k+2-1) = k^2 + 2k + 1
    $$
    Factor the resulting expression.
    $$
    S_{k+1} = (k+1)^2
    $$
    This is exactly the RHS of the statement for $n=k+1$.
4.  **Conclusion:**
    Since the base case is true and the inductive step holds, by the principle of mathematical induction, the formula is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

**Answer:** The proof is complete as shown in the steps above.
</details>

##### **5.6. Induction with Divisibility**
**Question:** Prove that $5^n - 1$ is divisible by 4 for all integers $n \ge 1$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Base Case ($n=1$):**
    For $n=1$, the expression is $5^1 - 1 = 4$. Since 4 is divisible by 4, the base case holds.
2.  **Inductive Step:**
    *   **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for some integer $k \ge 1$, $5^k - 1$ is divisible by 4. This means we can write $5^k - 1 = 4m$ for some integer $m$.
    *   **Goal:** We need to prove that $5^{k+1} - 1$ is also divisible by 4.
3.  **Proof:**
    Start with the expression for $k+1$ and manipulate it algebraically to use the inductive hypothesis.
    $$
    5^{k+1} - 1 = 5 \cdot 5^k - 1
    $$
    From the hypothesis, we know $5^k = 4m + 1$. Substitute this into the expression.
    $$
    5^{k+1} - 1 = 5(4m + 1) - 1 = 20m + 5 - 1 = 20m + 4
    $$
    Factor out a 4 from the result.
    $$
    5^{k+1} - 1 = 4(5m + 1)
    $$
    Since $m$ is an integer, $5m+1$ is also an integer. Therefore, $5^{k+1} - 1$ is a multiple of 4.
4.  **Conclusion:**
    The base case is true and the inductive step has been proven. By the principle of mathematical induction, $5^n - 1$ is divisible by 4 for all $n \ge 1$.

**Answer:** The proof is complete as shown in the steps above.
</details>

##### **5.7. Induction with an Inequality**
**Question:** Prove that for all integers $n \ge 4$, $2^n > 3n$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Base Case ($n=4$):**
    The base case here is $n=4$.
    LHS: $2^4 = 16$.
    RHS: $3(4) = 12$.
    Since $16 > 12$, the base case is true.
2.  **Inductive Step:**
    *   **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume for some integer $k \ge 4$ that $2^k > 3k$.
    *   **Goal:** We need to prove that $2^{k+1} > 3(k+1)$.
3.  **Proof:**
    Start with the LHS of the goal inequality and use the hypothesis.
    $$
    2^{k+1} = 2 \cdot 2^k
    $$
    By the inductive hypothesis, $2^k > 3k$, so we can substitute to get an inequality.
    $$
    2 \cdot 2^k > 2 \cdot (3k) = 6k
    $$
    Now we need to show that this result, $6k$, is greater than our target RHS, $3(k+1)$. Let's compare them. We want to show $6k > 3(k+1)$.
    $$
    6k > 3k + 3 \implies 3k > 3 \implies k > 1
    $$
    Since our induction is for $k \ge 4$, the condition $k > 1$ is certainly true.
    Therefore, we have the chain of inequalities: $2^{k+1} = 2 \cdot 2^k > 6k > 3(k+1)$.
4.  **Conclusion:**
    Since the base case and inductive step are true, by the principle of mathematical induction, $2^n > 3n$ for all integers $n \ge 4$.

**Answer:** The proof is complete as shown in the steps above.
