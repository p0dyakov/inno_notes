#### 1. Summary

##### 1.1 Complex Numbers

A **complex number** is a number that can be expressed in the form $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit, satisfying the equation $i^2 = -1$. The number $x$ is called the *real part* of $z$, and $y$ is the *imaginary part*.

While the rectangular form $x + iy$ is useful for addition and subtraction, the **trigonometric form** (also known as polar form) is often more convenient for multiplication and division.

###### 1.1.1 Trigonometric Form

Any complex number $z$ can be represented as $z = r(\cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta))$. This form is derived from representing the complex number as a point $(x, y)$ in the complex plane.

*   The **modulus** (or absolute value) $r$ is the distance from the origin to the point $(x, y)$. It is calculated as:
    $$ r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} $$
    The modulus is always a non-negative real number.

*   The **argument** $\theta$ is the angle formed by the positive real axis and the line segment from the origin to the point $(x, y)$. It is typically measured in radians and restricted to the interval $[0, 2\pi)$. The argument is found using the relationships:
    $$ \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r}, \quad \sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{r}, \quad \tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x} $$
    When using `arctan(y/x)` to find $\theta$, care must be taken to place the angle in the correct quadrant based on the signs of $x$ and $y$.
    *   **Quadrant I** ($x > 0, y \ge 0$): $\theta = \arctan(y/x)$
    *   **Quadrant II** ($x < 0, y > 0$): $\theta = \arctan(y/x) + \pi$
    *   **Quadrant III** ($x < 0, y < 0$): $\theta = \arctan(y/x) + \pi$
    *   **Quadrant IV** ($x > 0, y < 0$): $\theta = \arctan(y/x) + 2\pi$

##### 1.2 De Moivre's Theorem

De Moivre's Theorem provides a powerful formula for calculating powers of complex numbers in trigonometric form. It states that for any integer $n$:
$$ (\cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta))^n = \cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta) $$

This theorem is fundamental for two main applications:

1.  **Powers of Complex Numbers:** To compute $z^n$, first convert $z$ to its trigonometric form $r(\cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta))$. Then, $z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta))$.

2.  **Roots of Complex Numbers:** The theorem can be extended to find the $n$-th roots of a complex number. A non-zero complex number $z$ has exactly $n$ distinct $n$-th roots, given by the formula:
    $$ \sqrt[n]{z} = \sqrt[n]{r} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right) $$
    for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1$.

##### 1.3 Geometric Representation of Complex Numbers

Complex numbers can be visualized as points or vectors in a two-dimensional Cartesian plane called the **complex plane**. The horizontal axis represents the real part, and the vertical axis represents the imaginary part.

The modulus $|z|$ represents the length of the vector from the origin to the point $z$. More generally, the expression $|z - a|$ represents the distance between the points $z$ and $a$ in the complex plane. This interpretation allows us to describe geometric shapes:

*   **Circle:** The equation $|z - a| = r$ describes a circle with center $a$ and radius $r$.
*   **Disk:** The inequality $|z - a| \le r$ describes a closed disk (the circle and its interior).
*   **Annulus:** The inequality $r_1 < |z - a| \le r_2$ describes an annulus (a ring-like region) between two concentric circles.

##### 1.4 Basic Set Theory

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects, called **elements** or members. Sets are fundamental to modern mathematics.

*   **Subset ($\subset$):** A set $A$ is a subset of a set $B$ if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.
*   **Empty Set ($\emptyset$ or `{}`):** The unique set containing no elements.
*   **Set Operations:**
    *   **Union ($\cup$):** The set of all elements that are in $A$, or in $B$, or in both.
    *   **Intersection ($\cap$):** The set of all elements that are in both $A$ and $B$.
    *   **Difference ($\setminus$):** $A \setminus B$ is the set of all elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.
    *   **Complement ($A^c$):** The set of all elements in the universal set $U$ that are not in $A$.

```

*   **De Morgan's Laws:** These laws relate the operations of union, intersection, and complement:
    *   $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$
    *   $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$

##### 1.5 Real Numbers and Their Properties

The set of **real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$)** encompasses rational and irrational numbers. Subsets include:

*   **Natural Numbers ($\mathbb{N}$)**: $\{1, 2, 3, ...\}$
*   **Integers ($\mathbb{Z}$)**: $\{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\}$
*   **Rational Numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$)**: Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$.

###### 1.5.1 Bounds and Completeness

*   An **upper bound** of a set $S$ is a number greater than or equal to every element in $S$. A set that has an upper bound is **bounded above**.
*   The **supremum** (`sup(S)`) is the *least upper bound*. It is the smallest of all upper bounds.
*   A **lower bound** of a set $S$ is a number less than or equal to every element in $S$. A set that has a lower bound is **bounded below**.
*   The **infimum** (`inf(S)`) is the *greatest lower bound*. It is the largest of all lower bounds.

The **Completeness Axiom** is a defining property of real numbers. It states that every non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a supremum that is also a real number. This axiom ensures that there are no "gaps" in the real number line.

###### 1.5.2 Archimedean Property and Density

*   **Archimedean Property:** For any real number $x$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $n > x$. This implies there are no infinitely large or infinitely small real numbers.
*   **Density of Rationals:** Between any two distinct real numbers, there exists at least one rational number. This means the rational numbers are "densely" spread throughout the real number line. Similarly, the irrational numbers are also dense in the reals.

##### 1.6 Mathematical Induction

The **Principle of Mathematical Induction** is a formal method for proving that a statement $P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers $n$ (or all $n$ from a certain starting point). It works like a chain reaction or a line of falling dominoes.

```{=tex}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7, every node/.style={scale=0.7}]
    % Basis
    \node at (-1.5, 1.5) {basis};
    \draw[thick] (-2,0) -- (-1,1);
    \node at (-1.5, -0.5) {1};

    \node at (0.2, 0.5) {and};

    % Induction Hypothesis
    \node at (2.5, 1.5) {induction hypothesis};
    \draw[thick] (1.5,0) -- (2.5,1);
    \draw[thick] (2.7,0) -- (3.7,1);
    \node at (2, -0.5) {$n$};
    \node at (3.2, -0.5) {$n+1$};
    \node at (2.6, 1) {$(\forall n)$};

    \node at (1.5, -1.5) {imply};
    \draw[->, thick, shorten >=2pt, shorten <=2pt] (1.5, -1.8) -- (1.5, -2.2);

    % Domino Chain
    \begin{scope}[yshift=-3.5cm]
        \foreach \i in {1,2,3,4,5,6} {
            \draw[thick] (\i*1-1,0) -- (\i*1,1);
            \node at (\i*1-0.5, -0.5) {\i};
        }
        \node at (7.5, 0.5) {$\cdot \cdot \cdot$};
    \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

The proof requires two steps:
1.  **Base Case:** Prove that the statement $P(n)$ is true for the first value, typically $n = 1$. This is like tipping the first domino.
2.  **Inductive Step:** Assume that $P(k)$ is true for some arbitrary natural number $k$ (this is the *inductive hypothesis*). Then, using this assumption, prove that $P(k+1)$ must also be true. This shows that if any domino falls, it will knock over the next one.

If both steps are successfully proven, the principle of mathematical induction guarantees the statement is true for all natural numbers $n$.

#### 2. Definitions

*   **Complex Number**: A number of the form $x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $i^2 = -1$.
*   **Modulus**: The non-negative distance $r$ of a complex number from the origin in the complex plane, calculated as $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
*   **Argument**: The angle $\theta$ a complex number's vector makes with the positive real axis, measured counter-clockwise.
*   **Set**: A well-defined collection of distinct objects, known as elements.
*   **Subset**: A set $A$ is a subset of $B$ if all elements of $A$ are also elements of $B$.
*   **Union**: The union of sets $A$ and $B$ is a set containing all elements that are in $A$, or in $B$, or in both.
*   **Intersection**: The intersection of sets $A$ and $B$ is a set containing all elements that are common to both $A$ and $B$.
*   **Supremum (sup)**: The least upper bound of a set; the smallest value that is greater than or equal to all elements in the set.
*   **Infimum (inf)**: The greatest lower bound of a set; the largest value that is less than or equal to all elements in the set.
*   **Countable Set**: A set whose elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.
*   **Uncountable Set**: An infinite set that is not countable.

#### 3. Formulas

*   **Trigonometric Form of a Complex Number**: $z = r(\cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta))$
*   **Modulus of a Complex Number**: $r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
*   **Argument $\theta$ from Rectangular Coordinates**:
    *   Quadrant I: $\theta = \arctan(y/x)$
    *   Quadrants II & III: $\theta = \arctan(y/x) + \pi$
    *   Quadrant IV: $\theta = \arctan(y/x) + 2\pi$
*   **De Moivre's Theorem (Powers)**: $z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta))$
*   **De Moivre's Theorem (Roots)**: $\sqrt[n]{z} = \sqrt[n]{r} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right)$ for $k = 0, 1, ..., n-1$.
*   **De Morgan's Laws**:
    *   $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$
    *   $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$

#### 4. Mistakes

*   **Incorrectly calculating the argument $\theta$:** Using `arctan(y/x)` without checking the quadrant of the complex number. **Why it's wrong:** The `arctan` function has a restricted range of $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$, which only covers quadrants I and IV. For numbers in quadrants II and III, $\pi$ must be added to the result to get the correct angle.
*   **Confusing Supremum with Maximum:** Believing that the least upper bound (supremum) of a set must be an element of the set. **Why it's wrong:** The maximum must belong to the set, but the supremum does not have to. For example, the open interval $(0, 1)$ is bounded above by $1$, and $1$ is its supremum, but the set does not contain $1$, so it has no maximum.
*   **Assuming $A \setminus B = B \setminus A$:** Thinking that set difference is a commutative operation. **Why it's wrong:** $A \setminus B$ contains elements in $A$ but not in $B$, while $B \setminus A$ contains elements in $B$ but not in $A$. These are two different sets unless $A=B$.
*   **Flawed Inductive Step:** In a proof by induction, showing that $P(k+1)$ is true without correctly using the inductive hypothesis $P(k)$. **Why it's wrong:** The core logic of induction is proving the implication $P(k) \implies P(k+1)$. If the assumption $P(k)$ isn't used to prove $P(k+1)$, the logical chain is broken, and the proof is invalid.
*   **Forgetting to check the base case:** Starting an inductive proof directly with the inductive step. **Why it's wrong:** The inductive step only proves that *if* a domino falls, the *next* one will fall. The base case is what proves the *first* domino falls, starting the entire chain reaction. Without it, the proof is incomplete.
*   **Treating $\infty$ as a real number:** Performing arithmetic operations like $\infty - \infty$ or $\infty / \infty$. **Why it's wrong:** Infinity is not part of the real number system ($\mathbb{R}$). It is a concept used to describe limits and the size of unbounded sets. Expressions like $\infty - \infty$ are indeterminate forms, not defined operations.

#### 5. Examples

##### Example 1: Rectangular to Trigonometric Form (Quadrant II)
**Question:** Convert the complex number $z = -1 + \sqrt{3}i$ to its trigonometric form.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find the modulus $r$:** The real part is $x = -1$ and the imaginary part is $y = \sqrt{3}$.
    $$ r = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{1 + 3} = \sqrt{4} = 2 $$
2.  **Find the argument $\theta$:** The point $(-1, \sqrt{3})$ is in Quadrant II.
    $$ \tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{-1} = -\sqrt{3} $$
    The reference angle is $\arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \pi/3$. Since we are in Quadrant II, the correct angle is $\theta = \pi - \pi/3 = 2\pi/3$.
    *Alternatively, using the formula:* $\theta = \arctan(-\sqrt{3}) + \pi = -\pi/3 + \pi = 2\pi/3$.
3.  **Write the final form:** Substitute $r$ and $\theta$ into $r(\cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta))$.

**Answer:** The trigonometric form is **$2(\cos(2\pi/3) + i \sin(2\pi/3))$**.

##### Example 2: De Moivre's Theorem for Powers
**Question:** Calculate $(1 + i)^8$.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Convert $1 + i$ to trigonometric form:**
    *   $r = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}$.
    *   $\theta = \arctan(1/1) = \pi/4$ (Quadrant I).
    *   So, $1 + i = \sqrt{2}(\cos(\pi/4) + i \sin(\pi/4))$.
2.  **Apply De Moivre's Theorem:** Let $n = 8$.
    $$ (\sqrt{2})^8 \left( \cos\left(8 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(8 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right) $$
3.  **Simplify the expression:**
    *   $(\sqrt{2})^8 = 2^4 = 16$.
    *   $\cos(2\pi) = 1$.
    *   $\sin(2\pi) = 0$.
    *   The result is $16(1 + i \cdot 0) = 16$.

**Answer:** $(1 + i)^8 = \textbf{16}$.

##### Example 3: Finding Complex Roots
**Question:** Find the three cube roots of $z = -8$.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Convert $z = -8$ to trigonometric form:**
    *   $x = -8$, $y = 0$.
    *   $r = \sqrt{(-8)^2 + 0^2} = 8$.
    *   The point $(-8, 0)$ is on the negative real axis, so $\theta = \pi$.
    *   $z = 8(\cos(\pi) + i \sin(\pi))$.
2.  **Apply the n-th root formula** with $n=3$, $r=8$, $\theta=\pi$. The formula is $\sqrt[3]{8} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\pi + 2k\pi}{3}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\pi + 2k\pi}{3}\right) \right)$.
3.  **Calculate the roots for $k=0, 1, 2$:**
    *   **For $k=0$:** $2(\cos(\pi/3) + i \sin(\pi/3)) = 2(1/2 + i\sqrt{3}/2) = 1 + \sqrt{3}i$.
    *   **For $k=1$:** $2(\cos((\pi+2\pi)/3) + i \sin((\pi+2\pi)/3)) = 2(\cos(\pi) + i \sin(\pi)) = 2(-1 + 0i) = -2$.
    *   **For $k=2$:** $2(\cos((\pi+4\pi)/3) + i \sin((\pi+4\pi)/3)) = 2(\cos(5\pi/3) + i \sin(5\pi/3)) = 2(1/2 - i\sqrt{3}/2) = 1 - \sqrt{3}i$.

**Answer:** The three cube roots are **$1 + \sqrt{3}i$**, **$-2$**, and **$1 - \sqrt{3}i$**.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Interpret the formula:** The expression $|z - a| = r$ represents the set of all points $z$ whose distance from a fixed point $a$ is equal to $r$.
2.  **Identify the center $a$ and radius $r$:**
    *   In our case, $a = 2i$, which corresponds to the point $(0, 2)$.
    *   The radius is $r = 4$.
3.  **State the geometric shape:** This is the definition of a circle.

**Answer:** The set is a **circle with center at $(0, 2)$ (or $2i$) and a radius of 4**.
</details>

##### Example 5: Set Operations
**Question:** Let $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$. Find $A \cup B$, $A \cap B$, and $A \setminus B$.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find the Union ($A \cup B$):** Combine all unique elements from both sets.
    $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.
2.  **Find the Intersection ($A \cap B$):** Identify the elements that are present in both sets.
    $\{3, 4\}$.
3.  **Find the Difference ($A \setminus B$):** Start with set A and remove any elements that are also in set B.
    $\{1, 2\}$.

**Answer:**
*   $A \cup B = \textbf{\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}}$
*   $A \cap B = \textbf{\{3, 4\}}$
*   $A \setminus B = \textbf{\{1, 2\}}$
</details>

##### Example 6: Supremum and Infimum
**Question:** Find the infimum and supremum of the set $S = \{1/n \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\} = \{1, 1/2, 1/3, ...\}$.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Analyze the set's elements:** The sequence starts at 1 and decreases, getting closer and closer to 0 as $n$ gets larger.
2.  **Find the supremum (least upper bound):** The largest element in the set is $1$ (when $n=1$). All other elements are smaller. Therefore, $1$ is an upper bound. Since $1$ is in the set, it must be the least upper bound.
3.  **Find the infimum (greatest lower bound):** All elements are positive, so $0$ is a lower bound. For any number $\epsilon > 0$, we can find a natural number $n$ such that $1/n < \epsilon$ (by the Archimedean property). This means no positive number can be a lower bound. Therefore, $0$ must be the greatest lower bound.

**Answer:** `sup(S)` = **1** and `inf(S)` = **0**.
</details>

##### Example 7: Proof by Induction (Summation)
**Question:** Prove that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the sum $1 + 2 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Base Case ($n=1$):**
    *   Left-hand side (LHS): $1$.
    *   Right-hand side (RHS): $\frac{1(1+1)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$.
    *   LHS = RHS, so the base case holds.
2.  **Inductive Step:**
    *   **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the formula is true for $n=k$: $1 + 2 + ... + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.
    *   **Goal:** Prove the formula is true for $n=k+1$: $1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}$.
    *   **Proof:** Start with the LHS of the goal and use the hypothesis:
        $(1 + 2 + ... + k) + (k+1)$
        $= \left[\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right] + (k+1)$ (substituting the hypothesis)
        $= \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2}$ (finding a common denominator)
        $= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}$ (factoring out $k+1$)
    *   This matches the RHS of our goal. The inductive step is complete.
3.  **Conclusion:** By the principle of mathematical induction, the formula is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

**Answer:** The proof is complete as shown.
</details>

##### Example 8: Proof by Induction (Inequality)
**Question:** Prove Bernoulli's inequality: $(1 + x)^n \ge 1 + nx$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $x \ge -1$.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Base Case ($n=1$):**
    *   LHS: $(1+x)^1 = 1+x$.
    *   RHS: $1 + 1x = 1+x$.
    *   LHS = RHS, so the inequality holds (with equality).
2.  **Inductive Step:**
    *   **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume true for $n=k$: $(1+x)^k \ge 1+kx$.
    *   **Goal:** Prove true for $n=k+1$: $(1+x)^{k+1} \ge 1+(k+1)x$.
    *   **Proof:** Start with the LHS of the goal:
        $(1+x)^{k+1} = (1+x)^k (1+x)$
        Since $(1+x) \ge 0$ (because $x \ge -1$), we can multiply both sides of the hypothesis by $(1+x)$ without changing the inequality direction:
        $(1+x)^k (1+x) \ge (1+kx)(1+x)$
        $(1+x)^{k+1} \ge 1 + x + kx + kx^2$
        $(1+x)^{k+1} \ge 1 + (k+1)x + kx^2$
        Since $k > 0$ and $x^2 \ge 0$, the term $kx^2$ is non-negative. Therefore:
        $1 + (k+1)x + kx^2 \ge 1 + (k+1)x$
        By transitivity, we have $(1+x)^{k+1} \ge 1+(k+1)x$.
3.  **Conclusion:** By the principle of mathematical induction, the inequality is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

**Answer:** The proof is complete as shown.

##### Example 9: Proof by Induction (Divisibility)
**Question:** Prove that $7^n - 1$ is divisible by 6 for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Base Case ($n=1$):**
    *   $7^1 - 1 = 6$.
    *   $6$ is divisible by 6. The base case holds.
2.  **Inductive Step:**
    *   **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume $7^k - 1$ is divisible by 6. This means $7^k - 1 = 6m$ for some integer $m$. So, $7^k = 6m + 1$.
    *   **Goal:** Prove $7^{k+1} - 1$ is divisible by 6.
    *   **Proof:** Manipulate the expression for $n=k+1$:
        $7^{k+1} - 1 = 7 \cdot 7^k - 1$
        Substitute the hypothesis $7^k = 6m + 1$:
        $= 7(6m + 1) - 1$
        $= 42m + 7 - 1$
        $= 42m + 6$
        $= 6(7m + 1)$
    *   Since $m$ is an integer, $7m+1$ is also an integer. Thus, $7^{k+1} - 1$ is a multiple of 6.
3.  **Conclusion:** By the principle of mathematical induction, $7^n - 1$ is divisible by 6 for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

**Answer:** The proof is complete as shown.
