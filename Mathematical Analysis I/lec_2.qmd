#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Complex Numbers in Trigonometric Form**
A **complex number** is a number that can be expressed in the form **`z = a + bi`**, where `a` is the **real part** and `bi` is the **imaginary part**. While this rectangular form is useful, the **trigonometric form** (also called polar form) provides deeper insight into the number's geometric properties.

To convert `z = a + bi` to trigonometric form, `z = r(cos(θ) + i sin(θ))`, we need two components:
1.  **The Modulus (`r`):** This is the *magnitude* of the complex number, representing its distance from the origin (0,0) in the complex plane. It is calculated using the formula: **`r = |z| = sqrt(a² + b²)`**.
2.  **The Argument (`θ`):** This is the *angle* in radians that the line segment from the origin to the point `(a,b)` makes with the positive real axis. The argument is found using trigonometry, typically **`θ = arctan(b/a)`**, but care must be taken to adjust the angle based on the quadrant in which the point `(a,b)` lies to ensure `θ` is in the interval `[0, 2π)`.

##### **1.1.1 Powers and Roots of Complex Numbers (De Moivre's Theorem)**
De Moivre's Theorem provides a straightforward way to calculate powers and roots of complex numbers when they are in trigonometric form.

*   **Powers:** To raise a complex number `z = r(cos(θ) + i sin(θ))` to an integer power `n`, you raise the modulus `r` to the power of `n` and multiply the argument `θ` by `n`:
    $$ z^n = r^n(cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ)) $$
*   **Roots:** To find the `n`-th roots of a complex number, you find the `n`-th root of the modulus `r` and adjust the argument. A complex number has exactly `n` distinct `n`-th roots, which are spaced evenly around a circle in the complex plane. The formula is:
    $$ z^{1/n} = r^{1/n} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right) $$
    where `k` is an integer that ranges from `0` to `n-1`. Each value of `k` produces a different root.

##### **1.2 Geometric Representation of Complex Numbers**
Complex numbers can be visualized as points or vectors in a two-dimensional space called the **complex plane**. The horizontal axis represents the real part, and the vertical axis represents the imaginary part. This geometric view allows us to interpret algebraic equations as geometric shapes. For example, the equation `|z - c| = r` describes a circle with center `c` and radius `r`, where `z` is any point on the circle.

##### **1.3 Introduction to Mathematical Analysis**
**Real analysis** is the branch of mathematics that provides the rigorous, theoretical foundation for calculus. While calculus teaches *how* to use concepts like limits, derivatives, and integrals, real analysis explains *why* these tools work. It is built upon a formal, axiomatic system to prove mathematical statements with absolute certainty, avoiding the pitfalls of relying on intuition or observed patterns, which can sometimes be misleading.

##### **1.4 Set Theory Fundamentals**
Analysis uses the language of sets. A **set** is a collection of distinct objects, called **elements** or **members**. The fundamental concepts include:
*   **Subset (`⊂`):** A set `A` is a subset of `B` if every element of `A` is also an element of `B`.
*   **Set Operations:**
    *   **Union (`∪`):** `A ∪ B` is the set of all elements that are in `A`, or in `B`, or in both.
    *   **Intersection (`∩`):** `A ∩ B` is the set of all elements that are in both `A` and `B`.
    *   **Difference (`\`):** `A \ B` is the set of elements that are in `A` but not in `B`.
    *   **Complement (`A'` or `Aᶜ`):** The set of all elements in the universal set `U` that are not in `A`.
*   **Cartesian Product (`×`):** `A × B` is the set of all possible ordered pairs `(a, b)` where `a` is in `A` and `b` is in `B`.

##### **1.5 The Real Number System**
The real numbers (`ℝ`) are formally defined through a set of axioms—statements assumed to be true without proof—from which all other properties can be logically derived. These are grouped into three categories.

##### **1.5.1 Algebraic Axioms**
These axioms define the properties of addition and multiplication, establishing that the real numbers form a **field**. They include laws such as commutativity (`a + b = b + a`), associativity (`(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`), the existence of additive and multiplicative identities (0 and 1), and the existence of inverses for every element (additive inverse `-a` and multiplicative inverse `a⁻¹` for `a ≠ 0`).

##### **1.5.2 Order Axioms**
These axioms define the concept of order (e.g., "less than or equal to," `≤`). They establish that for any two real numbers `a` and `b`, exactly one of `a < b`, `a = b`, or `a > b` must be true (trichotomy). They also ensure that inequalities are preserved under addition and under multiplication by positive numbers.

##### **1.5.3 Completeness Axiom**
This is the crucial axiom that distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers. It states that there are no "gaps" or "holes" in the real number line. Formally, it guarantees that every non-empty set of real numbers that has an upper bound must have a **least upper bound** (or **supremum**) that is also a real number. Similarly, every non-empty set with a lower bound has a **greatest lower bound** (or **infimum**).

##### **1.6 Subsets of Real Numbers**
The real numbers contain several important subsets:
*   **Natural Numbers (`ℕ`):** The counting numbers `{1, 2, 3, ...}`.
*   **Integers (`ℤ`):** Whole numbers, including positives, negatives, and zero `{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}`.
*   **Rational Numbers (`ℚ`):** Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction `p/q` of two integers, where `q ≠ 0`.
*   **Irrational Numbers (`ℝ \ ℚ`):** Real numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction, like `√2` and `π`.
A key property is that both rational and irrational numbers are **dense** in the real number line, meaning between any two distinct real numbers, you can always find another rational number and another irrational number.

##### **1.7 Countability**
Sets can be categorized by their size or **cardinality**.
*   A **countable set** is one whose elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. In simple terms, you can "list" all its elements, even if the list is infinite. The sets `ℕ`, `ℤ`, and `ℚ` are all countable.
*   An **uncountable set** is an infinite set whose elements cannot be listed. The set of real numbers `ℝ` is the classic example. The proof for this, known as **Cantor's diagonalization argument**, shows that no matter how you try to list all the real numbers, a new real number that is not on the list can always be constructed.

##### **1.8 Mathematical Induction**
**Mathematical induction** is a powerful and rigorous proof technique used to establish that a given statement is true for all natural numbers (or all integers from a certain starting point). It is a form of deductive reasoning, not to be confused with inductive reasoning used in science, which generalizes from observations. The principle works like a chain of dominoes:
1.  **Base Case:** Prove the statement is true for the first case (e.g., `n = 1`). This is like knocking over the first domino.
2.  **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for an arbitrary case `n = k` (the **inductive hypothesis**). Then, using this assumption, prove that the statement must also be true for the next case, `n = k + 1`. This shows that if any domino falls, the next one will also fall.
If both steps are successfully proven, the statement is true for all natural numbers `n` from the base case onward.

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Complex Number**: A number of the form `a + bi`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers and `i` is the imaginary unit satisfying `i² = -1`.
*   **Modulus**: The magnitude or absolute value of a complex number `z = a + bi`, calculated as `r = |z| = sqrt(a² + b²)`. It represents the distance from the origin to the point `(a,b)` in the complex plane.
*   **Argument**: The angle `θ` of a complex number, measured from the positive real axis to the line connecting the origin and the point representing the complex number in the complex plane.
*   **Set**: A well-defined collection of distinct objects, known as elements or members.
*   **Subset**: A set `A` is a subset of set `B` if all elements of `A` are also elements of `B`.
*   **Union (of sets)**: The set of all elements that are in at least one of the given sets.
*   **Intersection (of sets)**: The set of all elements that are common to all of the given sets.
*   **Supremum (Least Upper Bound)**: The smallest number that is greater than or equal to every element in a given set. The supremum may or may not be an element of the set.
*   **Infimum (Greatest Lower Bound)**: The largest number that is less than or equal to every element in a given set. The infimum may or may not be an element of the set.
*   **Countable Set**: A set whose elements can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.
*   **Uncountable Set**: An infinite set that is not countable.
*   **Mathematical Induction**: A proof technique used to prove statements about all natural numbers, involving a base case and an inductive step.

#### **3. Formulas**

*   **Trigonometric Form of a Complex Number**: `z = r(cos(θ) + i sin(θ))` where `r = |z|` and `θ = arg(z)`.
*   **De Moivre's Theorem for Powers**: `[r(cos(θ) + i sin(θ))]^n = r^n(cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ))`.
*   **De Moivre's Theorem for Roots**: The `n`-th roots of `z = r(cos(θ) + i sin(θ))` are given by:
    `z_k = r^(1/n) [cos((θ + 2kπ)/n) + i sin((θ + 2kπ)/n)]` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.
*   **De Morgan's Laws for Sets**:
    *   `(A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'`
    *   `(A ∩ B)' = A' ∪ B'`
*   **Bernoulli's Inequality**: For any integer `n ≥ 1` and any real number `x ≥ -1`:
    ` (1 + x)^n ≥ 1 + nx `

#### **4. Mistakes**

*   **Incorrectly Calculating the Argument (`θ`)**: Relying solely on `arctan(b/a)` without considering the quadrant of the complex number can lead to an angle that is off by `π` radians. **Why it's wrong:** The `arctan` function has a restricted range, typically `(-π/2, π/2)`, so it cannot distinguish between diagonally opposite quadrants (e.g., I and III). Always check the signs of `a` and `b` to place the angle correctly.
*   **Assuming Patterns from a Few Examples (Flawed Inductive Reasoning)**: Concluding a formula is true for all `n` just because it works for `n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5`. **Why it's wrong:** As seen in Moser's circle problem, a pattern can hold for several initial values but fail later. A rigorous proof, like mathematical induction, is required to generalize a property to all natural numbers.
*   **Manipulating Divergent Infinite Series**: Applying standard algebraic operations to a series that does not converge to a finite sum. For example, setting `S = 1 + 2 + 4 + ...`, then writing `2S = 2 + 4 + 8 + ... = S - 1`, which illogically implies `S = -1`. **Why it's wrong:** These algebraic manipulations are only valid for convergent series. For divergent series, they lead to nonsensical results.
*   **Improper Use of the Inductive Hypothesis**: In an inductive proof, assuming the statement `P(k)` and then trying to prove `P(k+1)` from scratch without using the assumption. **Why it's wrong:** The entire logic of induction rests on the "if-then" connection: *if* `P(k)` is true, *then* `P(k+1)` must also be true. The assumption `P(k)` is a necessary tool that must be used to establish the truth of the next step.
*   **Confusing Supremum/Infimum with Maximum/Minimum**: Assuming the supremum or infimum must be an element of the set. **Why it's wrong:** For the open interval `S = (0, 1)`, the `sup(S) = 1` and `inf(S) = 0`, but neither 0 nor 1 are elements of `S`. The maximum and minimum must belong to the set, while the supremum and infimum do not have to.
*   **Illegal Cancellation in Algebra**: Canceling a variable from both sides of an equation without considering the case where that variable is zero. For example, simplifying `x(x+1) = x²` to `x+1 = x` leads to the false conclusion `1 = 0`. **Why it's wrong:** Division by zero is undefined. The cancellation is only valid if you can guarantee the variable being canceled is non-zero. The correct approach is to move all terms to one side and factor: `x² - x(x+1) = 0` becomes `x(-1) = 0`, so `x = 0`.

#### **5. Examples**

##### **5.1. Converting to Trigonometric Form**
**Question:** Express the complex number `z = -1 + √3i` in trigonometric form.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find the modulus (r):** The modulus is the distance from the origin.
    $$ r = |z| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{1 + 3} = \sqrt{4} = 2 $$
2.  **Find the argument (θ):** The point `(-1, √3)` is in the second quadrant. We first find the reference angle `α`.
    $$ \alpha = \arctan\left(\frac{|\sqrt{3}|}{|-1|}\right) = \arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{\pi}{3} $$
3.  **Adjust for the correct quadrant:** Since the point is in the second quadrant, the argument is `θ = π - α`.
    $$ \theta = \pi - \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3} $$
4.  **Write the trigonometric form:** Substitute `r` and `θ` into `z = r(cos(θ) + i sin(θ))`.

**Answer:** **`z = 2(cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3))`**.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Convert `z = 1 + i` to trigonometric form:**
    *   Find the modulus: `r = sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2)`.
    *   Find the argument: The point `(1, 1)` is in the first quadrant. `θ = arctan(1/1) = π/4`.
    *   Trigonometric form: `z = sqrt(2)(cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4))`.
2.  **Apply De Moivre's theorem for powers `z^n = r^n(cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ))`:**
    *   Here `n = 8`.
    $$ (1 + i)^8 = (\sqrt{2})^8 \left( \cos\left(8 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(8 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right) $$
3.  **Simplify the expression:**
    $$ = 2^{8/2} (\cos(2\pi) + i \sin(2\pi)) $$

    $$ = 16 $$

**Answer:** **16**.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Convert `z = -8` (or `-8 + 0i`) to trigonometric form:**
    *   Modulus: `r = sqrt((-8)² + 0²) = 8`.
    *   Argument: The point `(-8, 0)` lies on the negative real axis. `θ = π`.
    *   Trigonometric form: `z = 8(cos(π) + i sin(π))`.
2.  **Apply the formula for n-th roots:**
    $$ z_k = 8^{1/3} \left[ \cos\left(\frac{\pi + 2k\pi}{3}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\pi + 2k\pi}{3}\right) \right] $$
    for `k = 0, 1, 2`.
3.  **Calculate each root for k = 0, 1, 2:**
    *   For **k = 0**:
        $$ z_0 = 2 \left( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = 1 + i\sqrt{3} $$
    *   For **k = 1**:
        $$ z_1 = 2 \left( \cos\left(\frac{\pi + 2\pi}{3}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{3}\right) \right) = 2(\cos(\pi) + i \sin(\pi)) = 2(-1 + 0i) = -2 $$
    *   For **k = 2**:
        $$ z_2 = 2 \left( \cos\left(\frac{\pi + 4\pi}{3}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{3}\right) \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = 1 - i\sqrt{3} $$

**Answer:** The three cube roots are **`1 + i√3`**, **`-2`**, and **`1 - i√3`**.

</details>

##### **5.4. Proof with Set Theory**
**Question:** Prove De Morgan's Law: `(A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'`.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

The proof requires showing that any element in `(A ∪ B)'` is also in `A' ∩ B'`, and vice-versa.

1.  **Part 1: Show that `(A ∪ B)' ⊆ A' ∩ B'`**
    *   Let `x` be an arbitrary element in `(A ∪ B)'`.
    *   By definition of complement, this means `x` is *not* in `A ∪ B`.
    *   If `x` is not in the union of A and B, it cannot be in A *and* it cannot be in B.
    *   So, `x ∉ A` and `x ∉ B`.
    *   By definition of complement, `x ∈ A'` and `x ∈ B'`.
    *   Since `x` is in both `A'` and `B'`, it must be in their intersection: `x ∈ A' ∩ B'`.
    *   Thus, `(A ∪ B)' ⊆ A' ∩ B'`.

2.  **Part 2: Show that `A' ∩ B' ⊆ (A ∪ B)'`**
    *   Let `y` be an arbitrary element in `A' ∩ B'`.
    *   By definition of intersection, this means `y ∈ A'` and `y ∈ B'`.
    *   By definition of complement, this means `y ∉ A` and `y ∉ B`.
    *   Since `y` is not in A and not in B, it cannot be in their union: `y ∉ A ∪ B`.
    *   By definition of complement, `y ∈ (A ∪ B)'`.
    *   Thus, `A' ∩ B' ⊆ (A ∪ B)'`.

3.  **Conclusion:** Since we have shown inclusion in both directions, the sets are equal.

**Answer:** The proof demonstrates that **`(A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'`**.

##### **5.5. Finding Supremum and Infimum**
**Question:** Find the infimum and supremum of the set `S = {1/n | n ∈ ℕ}` where `ℕ = {1, 2, 3, ...}`. Determine if they are also the minimum and maximum.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **List some elements of the set:**
    `S = {1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...}`
2.  **Find the Supremum (Least Upper Bound):**
    *   An *upper bound* is any number greater than or equal to all elements in `S`. We can see that `1` is an upper bound, as is `2`, `3`, etc.
    *   The *least upper bound* is the smallest of all possible upper bounds. The largest element in the set is `1` (when `n=1`). All other elements are less than `1`.
    *   Therefore, `sup(S) = 1`.
3.  **Find the Infimum (Greatest Lower Bound):**
    *   A *lower bound* is any number less than or equal to all elements in `S`. `0` is a lower bound, as is `-1`, `-2`, etc.
    *   The elements `1/n` get closer and closer to `0` as `n` becomes very large, but they never actually reach `0`.
    *   The *greatest lower bound* is the largest of all possible lower bounds, which is `0`.
    *   Therefore, `inf(S) = 0`.
4.  **Determine Minimum and Maximum:**
    *   The **maximum** is the largest element *in* the set. Since `sup(S) = 1` and `1` is an element of `S` (for `n=1`), `max(S) = 1`.
    *   The **minimum** is the smallest element *in* the set. Since `inf(S) = 0` but `0` is not an element of `S` (as there is no `n ∈ ℕ` such that `1/n = 0`), the set has no minimum.

**Answer:** **`sup(S) = max(S) = 1`**, and **`inf(S) = 0`**. The set has no minimum.

</details>

##### **5.6. Proof by Induction (Summation)**
**Question:** Prove by mathematical induction that for all `n ≥ 1`, `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2`.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

Let `P(n)` be the statement `1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2`.

1.  **Base Case (n=1):**
    *   Check if `P(1)` is true.
    *   Left-hand side (LHS): `1`.
    *   Right-hand side (RHS): `1(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1`.
    *   LHS = RHS, so the base case is true.
2.  **Inductive Step:**
    *   **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume `P(k)` is true for some arbitrary integer `k ≥ 1`. That is, assume `1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2`.
    *   **Prove `P(k+1)` is true:** We need to show that `1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2`.
    *   Start with the LHS of `P(k+1)`:
        $$ (1 + 2 + ... + k) + (k+1) $$
    *   Apply the inductive hypothesis to replace the sum up to `k`:
        $$ = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) $$
    *   Find a common denominator to combine the terms:
        $$ = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + \frac{2(k+1)}{2} $$
        $$ = \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2} $$
    *   Factor out the common term `(k+1)`:
        $$ = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} $$
    *   This is the RHS of `P(k+1)`.

3.  **Conclusion:** Since the base case is true and the inductive step holds, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all `n ≥ 1`.

**Answer:** The proof confirms by induction that **`1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2` for all `n ≥ 1`**.

</details>

##### **5.7. Proof by Induction (Inequality)**
**Question:** Prove by mathematical induction that `n! > 2^n` for all integers `n ≥ 4`.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

Let `P(n)` be the statement `n! > 2^n`.

1.  **Base Case (n=4):**
    *   Check if `P(4)` is true.
    *   LHS: `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`.
    *   RHS: `2^4 = 16`.
    *   `24 > 16`, so the base case is true.
2.  **Inductive Step:**
    *   **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume `P(k)` is true for some arbitrary integer `k ≥ 4`. That is, assume `k! > 2^k`.
    *   **Prove `P(k+1)` is true:** We need to show that `(k+1)! > 2^(k+1)`.
    *   Start with the LHS of `P(k+1)`:
        $$ (k+1)! = (k+1) \cdot k! $$
    *   Apply the inductive hypothesis (`k! > 2^k`):
        $$ > (k+1) \cdot 2^k $$
    *   Since we assumed `k ≥ 4`, we know that `k+1 > 2`. We can use this to make the inequality stronger.
        $$ > 2 \cdot 2^k $$
        $$ = 2^{k+1} $$
    *   We have shown that `(k+1)! > 2^{k+1}`, which is the RHS of `P(k+1)`.

3.  **Conclusion:** Since the base case is true and the inductive step holds, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all integers `n ≥ 4`.

**Answer:** The proof confirms by induction that **`n! > 2^n` for all `n ≥ 4`**.
