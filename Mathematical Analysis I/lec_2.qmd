#### 1. Summary

This guide covers two fundamental topics in mathematics: representing complex numbers using trigonometry and a powerful proof technique known as mathematical induction.

##### 1.1 Complex Numbers in Trigonometric Form

A **complex number** is typically written in the standard form `z = x + iy`, where `x` is the real part and `y` is the imaginary part. This form is great for addition and subtraction. However, for multiplication, division, and finding powers or roots, the **trigonometric form** is far more efficient.

To convert `z = x + iy` to trigonometric form, we think of it as a point `(x, y)` on a 2D plane, called the complex plane.

1.  **The Modulus (`r`)**: The **modulus** is the distance from the origin (0, 0) to the point `(x, y)`. It's always a non-negative real number. It's calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
    $$
    r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
    $$

2.  **The Argument (`θ`)**: The **argument** is the angle, measured in radians, from the positive real axis (the positive x-axis) to the line segment connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`. The angle is measured counter-clockwise and is typically kept in the interval `[0, 2π)`.
    *   The argument can be found using `tan(θ) = y/x`, but we must be careful to place `θ` in the correct quadrant based on the signs of `x` and `y`.
    *   Quadrant I (`x > 0, y > 0`): `θ = arctan(y/x)`
    *   Quadrant II (`x < 0, y > 0`): `θ = arctan(y/x) + π`
    *   Quadrant III (`x < 0, y < 0`): `θ = arctan(y/x) + π`
    *   Quadrant IV (`x > 0, y < 0`): `θ = arctan(y/x) + 2π`
    
    _Correction Note: The provided source material has a slightly unconventional formula for Quadrant IV. The formulas above are the standard way to ensure θ is in the [0, 2π) range when `arctan` returns a value in `(-π/2, π/2)`._

Once `r` and `θ` are known, the trigonometric form is:
$$
z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)
$$

This form is especially powerful when combined with **De Moivre's Theorem**, which provides a simple way to calculate powers and roots of complex numbers.

*   **Powers**: To raise a complex number to a power `n`, you raise the modulus to that power and multiply the argument by `n`.
    $$
    z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))
    $$
*   **Roots**: An `n`-th root of a complex number is not unique; there are `n` distinct roots.
    $$
    z_k = \sqrt[n]{r}\left[\cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right)\right]
    $$
    where `k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1`.

##### 1.2 The Principle of Mathematical Induction

**Mathematical induction** is a rigorous method for proving that a statement, let's call it `P(n)`, is true for all natural numbers `n`, starting from some initial value (usually `n=1`). It is not the same as inductive reasoning (guessing a pattern from examples), which can be misleading. As seen in Moser's circle problem, a pattern that holds for `n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5` can fail at `n=6`. Mathematical induction provides a formal proof that the pattern holds indefinitely.

The logic is analogous to the **domino effect**:
1.  You prove you can knock over the first domino.
2.  You prove that *any* falling domino will always knock over its immediate neighbor.
If both conditions are met, you have proven that all dominoes in the line will fall.

The formal proof has two required steps:

1.  **Base Case**: Prove that the statement `P(n)` is true for the first, or smallest, value of `n`. This is like tipping the first domino.
2.  **Inductive Step**: This is the crucial part.
    *   First, you *assume* the statement is true for an arbitrary natural number `k`. This assumption is called the **Inductive Hypothesis**. It's like assuming some `k`-th domino has fallen.
    *   Then, you must use this assumption to *prove* that the statement is also true for the next number, `k+1`. This proves that if the `k`-th domino falls, it will necessarily knock over the `(k+1)`-th domino.

If you can successfully complete both the base case and the inductive step, you have proven that the statement `P(n)` is true for all natural numbers `n` from your starting point onwards.

#### 2. Definitions

*   **Modulus of a Complex Number**: The non-negative distance `r` of the complex number from the origin on the complex plane.
*   **Argument of a Complex Number**: The angle `θ`, typically in radians, from the positive real axis to the complex number on the complex plane.
*   **Trigonometric Form**: A way of representing a complex number using its modulus and argument: `z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)`.
*   **Mathematical Induction**: A formal proof technique used to establish the truth of a statement for all natural numbers.
*   **Base Case**: The first step in an inductive proof, where the statement is proven true for the initial integer value.
*   **Inductive Hypothesis**: The assumption in the inductive step that the statement holds true for an arbitrary integer `k`.
*   **Inductive Step**: The process of proving that if the statement holds for `k`, it must also hold for `k+1`.

#### 3. Formulas

*   **Modulus**: `r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}`
*   **Trigonometric Form**: `z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)`
*   **De Moivre's Theorem (Powers)**: `z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))`
*   **Roots of a Complex Number**: `z_k = \sqrt[n]{r}\left[\cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right)\right]` for `k = 0, 1, \dots, n-1`.

#### 4. Mistakes

*   **Incorrectly Calculating the Argument `θ`**: A very common error is to calculate `θ` using `arctan(y/x)` without considering the signs of `x` and `y`. **Why it's wrong:** The `arctan` function on most calculators returns a value between `-π/2` and `π/2` (Quadrants I and IV). If your point is in Quadrant II or III, you must add `π` to the result to get the correct angle.
*   **Finding Only One Root**: When asked for the `n`-th roots of a complex number, students often forget to use the full `n`-th root formula for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`. **Why it's wrong:** A complex number has `n` distinct `n`-th roots. Using the formula only for `k=0` provides just the principal root, missing all the others.
*   **Confusing the Inductive Hypothesis with the Conclusion**: In the inductive step, you must *assume* `P(k)` is true and use it to *prove* `P(k+1)`. A fatal error is to start with the `P(k+1)` statement and work backward, as this assumes the very thing you are trying to prove.
*   **Skipping the Base Case**: The inductive step only proves that *if* one domino falls, the *next* one will fall. It doesn't prove that any domino falls in the first place. **Why it's wrong:** Without the base case, the chain of logic is never started. The statement might not be true for any number.

#### 5. Examples

##### Example 1: Convert to Trigonometric Form
**Question:** Convert the complex number `z = -1 + i√3` to its trigonometric form.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Calculate the modulus `r`**: The real part is `x = -1` and the imaginary part is `y = √3`.
    $$
    r = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{1 + 3} = \sqrt{4} = 2
    $$
2.  **Determine the quadrant**: Since `x` is negative and `y` is positive, the point `(-1, √3)` is in Quadrant II.
3.  **Calculate the argument `θ`**: We use the formula for Quadrant II.
    $$
    \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{-1}\right) + \pi = -\frac{\pi}{3} + \pi = \frac{2\pi}{3}
    $$
4.  **Write the final form**: Substitute `r` and `θ` into the standard trigonometric form.
    $$
    z = 2\left(\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)\right)
    $$

**Answer:** The trigonometric form is **$z = 2\left(\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)\right)$**.

##### Example 2: Powers using De Moivre's Theorem
**Question:** Compute `(1 + i)^8` using De Moivre's Theorem.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Convert `z = 1 + i` to trigonometric form**:
    *   Modulus: `r = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}`.
    *   Argument: The point is in Quadrant I, so `θ = \arctan(1/1) = \pi/4`.
    *   Trigonometric form: `z = \sqrt{2}(\cos(\pi/4) + i\sin(\pi/4))`.
2.  **Apply De Moivre's Theorem for n = 8**:
    $$
    z^8 = (\sqrt{2})^8 \left(\cos\left(8 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(8 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right)
    $$
3.  **Simplify the expression**:
    $$
    z^8 = 16 (\cos(2\pi) + i\sin(2\pi))
    $$
4.  **Evaluate the trigonometric functions**: `cos(2π) = 1` and `sin(2π) = 0`.
    $$
    z^8 = 16 (1 + i \cdot 0) = 16
    $$

**Answer:** $(1 + i)^8 = \textbf{16}$.

##### Example 3: Proof by Induction
**Question:** Prove by mathematical induction that for all integers `n ≥ 1`, the sum of the first `n` positive odd integers is `n^2`.
Statement `P(n)`: `1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n - 1) = n^2`.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Base Case (n=1)**: We check if the formula holds for `n=1`.
    *   Left-hand side (LHS): `1`
    *   Right-hand side (RHS): `1^2 = 1`
    *   Since LHS = RHS, the base case is true.
2.  **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume `P(k)` is true for an arbitrary integer `k ≥ 1`.
    *   Assumption: `1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) = k^2`.
3.  **Inductive Step**: We must now prove that `P(k+1)` is true, using the inductive hypothesis. We want to show: `1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2(k+1) - 1) = (k+1)^2`.
    *   Start with the left-hand side of `P(k+1)`:
    $$
    1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1)
    $$
    *   Notice that the first part of the sum is exactly the LHS of our inductive hypothesis. Substitute `k^2` for that part:
    $$
    = (k^2) + (2(k+1) - 1)
    $$
    *   Simplify the expression:
    $$
    = k^2 + (2k + 2 - 1)
    $$
    $$
    = k^2 + 2k + 1
    $$
    *   Factor the quadratic expression:
    $$
    = (k+1)^2
    $$
    *   This result is the right-hand side of `P(k+1)`. We have successfully shown that if `P(k)` is true, then `P(k+1)` must be true.

**Answer:** Since both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, the statement **holds true for all integers `n ≥ 1` by the principle of mathematical induction**.
