#### **1. Summary**

##### **1.1 Introduction to Functions, Domain, and Range**
A **function** is a fundamental concept in mathematics that describes a relationship between two sets of values. It can be thought of as a rule or a machine that takes an *input* from a set called the **domain** and produces a *single, unique output* in a set called the **codomain**. For every input, there is exactly one output.

*   **Domain**: The **domain** of a function is the complete set of all possible input values (often represented by the variable $x$) for which the function is defined. For example, in the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, we cannot take the square root of a negative number (in the set of real numbers), so the domain is all non-negative numbers, written as $x \ge 0$ or $[0, \infty)$.

*   **Range**: The **range** is the set of all possible output values (often represented by $y$ or $f(x)$) that the function can produce. For the same function, $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, the outputs are always non-negative, so the range is $[0, \infty)$.

##### **1.2 The Graph of a Function**
A function can be visually represented by its **graph** on a Cartesian plane (the standard $x-y$ coordinate system). The graph consists of all points $(x, y)$ where $x$ is an input from the domain and $y = f(x)$ is the corresponding output. Essentially, for any point on the graph, its $y$-coordinate represents the height of the function at that specific $x$-value. If $f(x)$ is positive, the point is above the x-axis; if negative, it's below.

##### **1.3 Special Step Functions: Floor and Ceiling**
Two common functions that operate on real numbers are the floor and ceiling functions. They are examples of *step functions* because their graphs look like a series of steps.

*   **Floor Function** (or **Greatest Integer Function**): Denoted as $\lfloor x \rfloor$, this function returns the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $x$. It effectively rounds a number *down* to the nearest integer.
    *   Examples: $\lfloor 2.9 \rfloor = 2$, $\lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2$, $\lfloor 3 \rfloor = 3$.

*   **Ceiling Function** (or **Least Integer Function**): Denoted as $\lceil x \rceil$, this function returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $x$. It effectively rounds a number *up* to the nearest integer.
    *   Examples: $\lceil 2.1 \rceil = 3$, $\lceil -1.5 \rceil = -1$, $\lceil 3 \rceil = 3$.

##### **1.4 Monotone Functions**
A function is **monotone** if it consistently follows a single trend over an interval. This describes the function's behavior as $x$ increases.

*   **Increasing Function**: A function $f$ is *increasing* if its output values either increase or stay the same as the input values increase. Formally, for any $x_1 < x_2$ in an interval, $f(x_1) \le f(x_2)$.
*   **Strictly Increasing Function**: A function is *strictly increasing* if its output values always increase as the input values increase. For any $x_1 < x_2$, $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$. The function $f(x) = x^3$ is strictly increasing everywhere.
*   **Decreasing Function**: A function $f$ is *decreasing* if its output values either decrease or stay the same as the input values increase. For any $x_1 < x_2$, $f(x_1) \ge f(x_2)$.
*   **Strictly Decreasing Function**: A function is *strictly decreasing* if its output values always decrease as the input values increase. For any $x_1 < x_2$, $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. The function $f(x) = -x$ is strictly decreasing everywhere.

The function $f(x) = x^2$ is strictly decreasing on the interval $(-\infty, 0]$ and strictly increasing on $[0, \infty)$.

##### **1.5 Combining Functions Arithmetically**
Just like numbers, functions can be combined using basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To combine two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we simply perform the operation on their outputs. The domain of the new combined function is the *intersection* of the domains of $f$ and $g$.

*   **Sum**: $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$
*   **Difference**: $(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)$
*   **Product**: $(f \cdot g)(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)$
*   **Quotient**: $(f / g)(x) = f(x) / g(x)$. For the quotient, we have an additional restriction: the domain must exclude any $x$ values for which $g(x) = 0$ to avoid division by zero.

##### **1.6 Composition of Functions**
Function **composition** is the process of applying one function to the result of another. The composition of $f$ with $g$, denoted $(f \circ g)(x)$, means we first evaluate $g(x)$ and then use that result as the input for $f$. So, $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$.

*   **Domain of a Composite Function**: The domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$ consists of all $x$ in the domain of $g$ for which the output $g(x)$ is in the domain of $f$.
*   *Order Matters*: It is crucial to remember that function composition is **not commutative**, meaning $(f \circ g)(x)$ is generally not the same as $(g \circ f)(x)$.

##### **1.7 One-to-One and Inverse Functions**
*   **One-to-One Function**: A function is **one-to-one** if every output in its range corresponds to exactly one unique input in its domain. In other words, no two different inputs produce the same output. Graphically, this can be checked with the *horizontal line test*: if no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, the function is one-to-one.
    *   Example: $f(x) = x^3$ is one-to-one.
    *   Non-Example: $f(x) = x^2$ is not one-to-one because, for example, $f(2)=4$ and $f(-2)=4$.

*   **Inverse Function**: Only one-to-one functions have an **inverse function**. The inverse function, denoted $f^{-1}(x)$, "reverses" the action of the original function. If $f(a) = b$, then $f^{-1}(b) = a$.
    *   The domain of $f^{-1}$ is the range of $f$.
    *   The range of $f^{-1}$ is the domain of $f$.
    *   Graphically, the graph of $f^{-1}(x)$ is a reflection of the graph of $f(x)$ across the line $y=x$.

##### **1.8 Even and Odd Functions**
This classification relates to a function's symmetry. The function's domain must be symmetric with respect to the origin (if $x$ is in the domain, then $-x$ must also be).

*   **Even Function**: A function $f$ is **even** if $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain. The graph of an even function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Example: $f(x) = \cos(x)$ and $f(x) = x^2$.
*   **Odd Function**: A function $f$ is **odd** if $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain. The graph of an odd function is symmetric with respect to the origin. Example: $f(x) = \sin(x)$ and $f(x) = x^3$.

##### **1.9 Elementary Functions and Their Properties**

###### **1.9.1 Power, Polynomial, and Rational Functions**
*   A **power function** has the form $f(x) = x^a$, where $a$ is a constant.
*   A **polynomial function** is a sum of power functions with non-negative integer exponents, of the form $p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0$. The domain of any polynomial is all real numbers $(-\infty, \infty)$.
*   A **rational function** is a ratio of two polynomials, $f(x) = p(x) / q(x)$. Its domain is all real numbers except for the values of $x$ that make the denominator $q(x)$ equal to zero.

###### **1.9.2 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions**
*   An **exponential function** has the form $f(x) = a^x$, where the base $a$ is a positive constant not equal to 1. The domain is $(-\infty, \infty)$ and the range is $(0, \infty)$. If $a>1$, the function is strictly increasing. The most common base is $e \approx 2.718$.
*   A **logarithmic function**, $f(x) = \log_a(x)$, is the inverse of the exponential function $a^x$. It answers the question: "to what power must we raise base $a$ to get $x$?". Its domain is $(0, \infty)$ and its range is $(-\infty, \infty)$. The natural logarithm, $\ln(x)$, has base $e$.

###### **1.9.3 Trigonometric and Inverse Trigonometric Functions**
*   **Trigonometric functions** (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.) describe relationships between angles and side lengths in right triangles. They are defined for any real number angle and are *periodic*, meaning their values repeat in regular intervals.
*   Because they are periodic, trigonometric functions are not one-to-one. To define their **inverse trigonometric functions** (arcsin, arccos, etc.), we must restrict their domains to a principal interval where they are one-to-one. For example, $\arcsin(x)$ returns an angle in $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.

<!-- DIAGRAM HERE -->

###### **1.9.4 Hyperbolic and Inverse Hyperbolic Functions**
*   **Hyperbolic functions** (sinh, cosh, etc.) are combinations of the exponential functions $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$. For example, $\sinh(x) = (e^x - e^{-x})/2$. They share many properties and identities analogous to trigonometric functions.
*   **Inverse hyperbolic functions** are the inverses of the hyperbolic functions (with domain restrictions where necessary, such as for $\cosh(x)$). They can be expressed in terms of natural logarithms. For example, $\text{arsinh}(x) = \ln(x + \sqrt{x^2+1})$.

#### **2. Definitions**

*   **Function**: A rule that assigns to each element in a set called the domain, exactly one element from a set called the codomain.
*   **Domain**: The set of all possible input values for which a function is defined.
*   **Range**: The set of all possible output values of a function.

*   **Monotone Function**: A function that is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing over an interval.
*   **One-to-One Function**: A function where each output value is produced by exactly one unique input value.
*   **Inverse Function $f^{-1}(x)$**: A function that reverses the action of a one-to-one function $f(x)$. If $f(a)=b$, then $f^{-1}(b)=a$.
*   **Even Function**: A function whose graph is symmetric about the y-axis, satisfying $f(-x) = f(x)$.
*   **Odd Function**: A function whose graph has rotational symmetry about the origin, satisfying $f(-x) = -f(x)$.
*   **Polynomial**: A function expressed as a sum of terms, each being a constant multiplied by a power of a variable with a non-negative integer exponent.
*   **Rational Function**: A function that is the ratio of two polynomial functions.
*   **Exponential Function**: A function of the form $f(x) = a^x$ where $a$ is a positive constant base.
*   **Logarithmic Function**: The inverse of an exponential function, written as $f(x) = \log_a(x)$.
*   **Periodic Function**: A function that repeats its values at regular intervals or periods.
*   **Hyperbolic Functions**: Functions defined using combinations of the exponential function $e^x$, such as $\sinh(x)$ and $\cosh(x)$.

#### **3. Formulas**

*   **Sum of Functions**: $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$
*   **Difference of Functions**: $(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)$
*   **Product of Functions**: $(f \cdot g)(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)$
*   **Quotient of Functions**: $(f / g)(x) = f(x) / g(x)$, where $g(x) \neq 0$
*   **Composition of Functions**: $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$
*   **Inverse Function Property**: $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ and $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$
*   **Pythagorean Identity**: $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$
*   **Hyperbolic Identity**: $\cosh^2(x) - \sinh^2(x) = 1$
*   **Hyperbolic Sine**: $\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$
*   **Hyperbolic Cosine**: $\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$
*   **Logarithm Product Rule**: $\ln(ab) = \ln(a) + \ln(b)$
*   **Logarithm Quotient Rule**: $\ln(a/b) = \ln(a) - \ln(b)$
*   **Logarithm Power Rule**: $\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)$
*   **Change of Base Formula**: $\log_b(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)}$
*   **Inverse Hyperbolic Sine (Log Form)**: $\text{arsinh}(x) = \ln(x + \sqrt{x^2+1})$

#### **4. Mistakes**

*   **Confusing Domain and Range:** A common mistake is to mix up the set of valid inputs (domain) with the set of possible outputs (range). **Why it's wrong:** The domain is determined by the function's definition (e.g., avoiding square roots of negatives), while the range is the result of applying the function to its entire domain.
*   **Assuming Function Composition is Commutative:** Believing that $f(g(x))$ is always the same as $g(f(x))$. **Why it's wrong:** The order of operations matters. Applying $g$ then $f$ is a different process than applying $f$ then $g$, usually leading to different results.
*   **Mistaking Inverse Notation for a Reciprocal:** Interpreting $f^{-1}(x)$ as $1/f(x)$. **Why it's wrong:** The $-1$ notation signifies an inverse function, not a multiplicative inverse (reciprocal). For example, $\sin^{-1}(x)$ is $\arcsin(x)$, not $\csc(x)$.
*   **Incorrectly Applying Logarithm Rules:** Applying rules incorrectly, such as stating $\ln(x+y) = \ln(x) + \ln(y)$. **Why it's wrong:** The logarithm of a sum is not the sum of the logarithms. The correct rule is $\ln(xy) = \ln(x) + \ln(y)$.
*   **Ignoring Domain Restrictions for Inverse Trigonometric Functions:** Forgetting that $\arcsin(\sin(x)) = x$ is only true for $x$ within the restricted range $-\pi/2 \le x \le \pi/2$. **Why it's wrong:** The output of $\arcsin$ is always in that restricted range, so for $x$ values outside it, the result will be a different angle that has the same sine value.
*   **Forgetting to Exclude Values from the Domain:** When finding the domain of a rational function $f(x) = p(x)/q(x)$, it's easy to forget to set $q(x) \neq 0$. **Why it's wrong:** Division by zero is an undefined mathematical operation, so any inputs that cause it must be excluded from the domain.

#### **5. Examples**

##### **5.1. Domain and Range**
**Question:** Find the domain and range of the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} + 5$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find the domain:** The expression inside the square root must be non-negative.
    $$ x - 3 \ge 0 $$
    $$ x \ge 3 $$
    The domain is $[3, \infty)$.

2.  **Find the range:** The square root term, $\sqrt{x-3}$, can only produce non-negative values ($\ge 0$).
    $$ \sqrt{x-3} \ge 0 $$
    We then add 5 to this value.
    $$ \sqrt{x-3} + 5 \ge 5 $$
    So, the output $f(x)$ will always be greater than or equal to 5. The range is $[5, \infty)$.

**Answer:** Domain: **$[3, \infty)$**; Range: **$[5, \infty)$**.
</details>

##### **5.2. Function Composition**
**Question:** Given $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ and $g(x) = 2x - 3$, find $(f \circ g)(x)$ and $(g \circ f)(x)$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Calculate $(f \circ g)(x)$**: This means $f(g(x))$. Substitute the entire expression for $g(x)$ into $f(x)$ wherever you see $x$.
    $$ (f \circ g)(x) = f(2x - 3) = (2x - 3)^2 + 1 $$
2.  **Expand and simplify**:
    $$ (4x^2 - 12x + 9) + 1 = 4x^2 - 12x + 10 $$
3.  **Calculate $(g \circ f)(x)$**: This means $g(f(x))$. Substitute the entire expression for $f(x)$ into $g(x)$.
    $$ (g \circ f)(x) = g(x^2 + 1) = 2(x^2 + 1) - 3 $$
4.  **Expand and simplify**:
    $$ 2x^2 + 2 - 3 = 2x^2 - 1 $$

**Answer:** $(f \circ g)(x) = 4x^2 - 12x + 10$; $(g \circ f)(x) = 2x^2 - 1$.
</details>

##### **5.3. Even and Odd Functions**
**Question:** Determine if the function $f(x) = x^3 - x$ is even, odd, or neither.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Find $f(-x)$**: Replace every instance of $x$ in the function with $-x$.
    $$ f(-x) = (-x)^3 - (-x) $$
2.  **Simplify the expression**:
    $$ f(-x) = -x^3 + x $$
3.  **Compare $f(-x)$ with $f(x)$ and $-f(x)$**:
    *   Is $f(-x) = f(x)$? Is $-x^3 + x = x^3 - x$? No. So, it is not even.
    *   Is $f(-x) = -f(x)$? Let's find $-f(x)$: $-(x^3 - x) = -x^3 + x$.
    *   Yes, $f(-x)$ is equal to $-f(x)$.

**Answer:** The function is **odd**.
</details>

##### **5.4. Finding an Inverse Function**
**Question:** Find the inverse of the function $f(x) = \frac{2x + 1}{x - 3}$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Replace $f(x)$ with $y$**:
    $$ y = \frac{2x + 1}{x - 3} $$
2.  **Swap $x$ and $y$**:
    $$ x = \frac{2y + 1}{y - 3} $$
3.  **Solve for $y$**:
    $$ x(y - 3) = 2y + 1 $$
    $$ xy - 3x = 2y + 1 $$
    $$ xy - 2y = 3x + 1 $$
    $$ y(x - 2) = 3x + 1 $$
    $$ y = \frac{3x + 1}{x - 2} $$
4.  **Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$**:
    $$ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{3x + 1}{x - 2} $$

**Answer:** The inverse function is **$f^{-1}(x) = \frac{3x + 1}{x - 2}$**.
</details>

##### **5.5. Logarithm Properties**
**Question:** Express $\ln(x^2) - 2\ln(y) + \ln(xy)$ as a single logarithm.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Apply the power rule**: $\ln(a^b) = b\ln(a)$. The first term is already in a usable form, but $2\ln(y)$ becomes $\ln(y^2)$.
    $$ \ln(x^2) - \ln(y^2) + \ln(xy) $$
2.  **Apply the quotient rule**: $\ln(a) - \ln(b) = \ln(a/b)$ to the first two terms.
    $$ \ln\left(\frac{x^2}{y^2}\right) + \ln(xy) $$
3.  **Apply the product rule**: $\ln(a) + \ln(b) = \ln(ab)$.
    $$ \ln\left(\frac{x^2}{y^2} \cdot xy\right) $$
4.  **Simplify the expression inside the logarithm**:
    $$ \ln\left(\frac{x^3 y}{y^2}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{x^3}{y}\right) $$

**Answer:** **$\ln\left(\frac{x^3}{y}\right)$**.
</details>

##### **5.6. Evaluating Inverse Trigonometric Functions**
**Question:** Find the exact value of $\cos(\arcsin(-\frac{1}{2}))$.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Evaluate the inner function**: Let $\theta = \arcsin(-\frac{1}{2})$. This means $\sin(\theta) = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $\theta$ must be in the range $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. The angle in this range whose sine is $-1/2$ is $\theta = -\pi/6$.

2.  **Substitute the angle back into the expression**: The problem now becomes finding $\cos(-\pi/6)$.

3.  **Use the property of cosine**: Cosine is an even function, so $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$.
    $$ \cos(-\pi/6) = \cos(\pi/6) $$

4.  **Evaluate the result**: The cosine of $\pi/6$ (or 30 degrees) is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

**Answer:** **$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$**.
</details>

##### **5.7. Proof of Hyperbolic Identity**
**Question:** Prove the identity $\cosh^2(x) - \sinh^2(x) = 1$ using the exponential definitions.
<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

1.  **Write out the definitions**:
    *   $\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$
    *   $\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$
2.  **Substitute the definitions into the left side of the identity**:
    $$ \left(\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}\right)^2 $$
3.  **Square both terms**:
    $$ \frac{(e^x + e^{-x})^2}{4} - \frac{(e^x - e^{-x})^2}{4} $$
    $$ \frac{e^{2x} + 2e^x e^{-x} + e^{-2x}}{4} - \frac{e^{2x} - 2e^x e^{-x} + e^{-2x}}{4} $$
4.  **Simplify $e^x e^{-x}$**: Since $e^x e^{-x} = e^{x-x} = e^0 = 1$, the expression becomes:
    $$ \frac{e^{2x} + 2 + e^{-2x}}{4} - \frac{e^{2x} - 2 + e^{-2x}}{4} $$
5.  **Combine the fractions**:
    $$ \frac{(e^{2x} + 2 + e^{-2x}) - (e^{2x} - 2 + e^{-2x})}{4} $$
    $$ \frac{e^{2x} + 2 + e^{-2x} - e^{2x} + 2 - e^{-2x}}{4} $$
6.  **Cancel terms and simplify**:
    $$ \frac{4}{4} = 1 $$
    This equals the right side of the identity.

**Answer:** The proof is complete as the left side simplifies to **1**.
